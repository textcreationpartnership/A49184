            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THOSE who have attentively read our</hi> Apology, <hi>and have ſeen how fully and clearly we vindicated our ſelves from the Calumnies wherewith the R. B. our Accuſer, had Aſperſed us in his Letter of Information, may poſſibly wonder to find the Reverend Mr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>coming in to the Accuſers aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and undertaking to make good the ſame Charge againſt us, that we are Corrupters of the Old, and Preachers of a New Goſpel, to the great danger of Peoples Souls. [See the</hi> Preface <hi>to his</hi> Diſcourſe of the true Nature of the Goſpel, <hi>and</hi> Chap. 4. Pag. 25. Lin. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 9. Pag. 74. Lin. 11, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 32, 33.] <hi>But if they duly conſider Mr.</hi> Goodwins <hi>Principles, they may ceaſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; for he profeſſes to believe that the Goſpel-Covenant is <q>no Law of Grace; that is, that it hath neither Precept, nor Conditional Promiſe, nor Threatning of its own, at all: And ſo that it re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uires no Duty at all, not ſo much as Faith in Chriſt, and conſequently that there are no Sins againſt the Goſpel.</q> The holding of this Opinion he judges to be of high importance to the Salvation of his own Soul; [See</hi> Epiſtle to the Reader, pag. 1. lin. 15, 16.] <hi>for it ſeems he is afraid that if the Goſpel have any Precept of its own, and require any Duty, or threaten any Sinner, then be is undone; and that if</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">See his <hi>Diſc.</hi> p. 54.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt as Mediatour be Judge, then he ſhall be condemned. Now it is no matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at all, that a Man of ſuch Principles doth accuſe us, and make a Clamour againſt us as dangerous perſons; for indeed we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Goſpel-Covenant which God hath made with his Church through the Mediatour Jeſus Chriſt, is a Law of Grace which hath not only Abſolute Promiſes, but hath alſo Precepts, Conditional Promiſes, and Threatnings of its own: That it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome Duties, and that thoſe who neglect to perform ſuch Duties, are guilty of Sins not only againſt the Moral Law, but againſt the Goſpel alſo. We do likewiſe believe that the Office of
<pb facs="tcp:93175:3"/>a Judge doth belong to a Mediator, and that Chriſt is both Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Judge; and that as Judge he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſome, yea many impenitent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers for Sins againſt the Goſpel. So that here is a contradictory oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition between the Goſpel which we ſtand for the defence of, (with a reſolution through Grace ſo to do
<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Mark</hi> 8.36, 37, 38.</note>), and the Goſpel that Mr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>would obtrude upon the World; which we think is ſo far from being the true Goſpel of Chriſt, that it is the Error of</hi> Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Illyricus, <hi>which was condemned and exploded by Famous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines of the Reformed Church long before we were born. And I hope the Reverend Mr,</hi> Trail <hi>will yet join with us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning that Error of the</hi> Flacians, <hi>as no part of Chriſts Goſpel, but a very groſs and dangerous Miſtake, eſpecially as improved by Mr.</hi> Goodwin: <hi>But whether he will do ſo or not, I am ſure the late Reverend and Learned Dr.</hi> Owen, <hi>and his worthy ſucceſſor Mr.</hi> Clarkſon, <hi>were of the ſame Faith with us, and are on our ſide in this matter. For</hi> (1.) <hi>Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>in his</hi> 3d <hi>Volume on the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, pa. 220. li. 4, 5, 6. <hi>ſays that,</hi> 
               <q>[<hi>The firſt Promiſe,</hi> Gen. 3.15. <hi>had in it the nature of a Covenant, grounded on a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Grace, and requiring Obedience in all that received the Promiſe.]</hi>

Every Covenant <hi>(ſaith the Dr.)</hi> that is propoſed unto Men, and accepted by them, requires ſomewhat to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their part, otherwiſe it is no Covenant]. <hi>Again in</hi> pag. 22<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. [I (<hi>Dr.</hi> Owen) do not ſay the Covenant of Grace is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute without Conditions, if by Conditions we intend the Duties of Obedience which God requires of us in and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Covenant]. <hi>And then from</hi> pag. 235, &amp;c. <hi>the Dr. in many particulars aſſigning the difference between the Old</hi> Sinai <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> as ſuch, <hi>and the New Goſpel-Covenant, when he gives the fifth difference, he ſays,</hi> [That the New Covenant hath for its Precepts, the Decalogue with ſome poſitive Laws; and for its Promiſes, they are moſtly of Spiritual and Eternal Bleſſings]. <hi>Thus Dr.</hi> Owen. <hi>In which paſſages, and others that I have cited
<pb facs="tcp:93175:3"/>out of his Writings, he agrees with us exactly, and aſſerts what we mean by the Goſpels being</hi> a Law, <hi>as the Scripture calls it.</hi> (2.) <hi>Mr.</hi> Clarkſon <hi>in his Book of Sermons and Diſcourſes on ſeveral Divine Subjects, newly Printed,</hi> 1696, <hi>and commended to the Reader by the Reverend Mr.</hi> How <hi>and Mr.</hi> Mead. <hi>In the Sermon on</hi> Luke 13.3. <hi>pag.</hi> 10. <hi>his obſervation is, that</hi> [Repentance is an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Duty; a Goſpel, a new Covenant Duty. This ſhould not be queſtioned by thoſe, who either believe what the Goſpel delivers, or underſtand what it is to be Evangelical. But ſince it is denyed, let us prove it.] <hi>And then he proves it by twelve Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. After this in</hi> p. 12, <hi>when he comes to the application of this Doctrine, he ſays,</hi> [It reproves thoſe who reject this Duty as Legal. Certainly thoſe who find not this in the Goſpel, have found another Goſpel beſides that which Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached. But let them take heed, leaſt whilſt they will go to Heaven in a way of their own, that way prove a by path, and lead to the gates of Death, inſtead of the place of Joy. No way but Chriſt will bring to Heaven, and that has three ſtages, Faith, Repentance and Obedience. He that will ſit down at the end of the firſt, and never enter upon the ſecond, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach Heaven. Indeed he that walks not in all, walks not in any; he is deluded, miſled by an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> a falſe fire; and if the Lord do not undeceive him, will fall into the bottomleſs pit.] <hi>And in</hi> p. 20. <hi>he ſays,</hi> 
               <q>[<hi>No Repentance, no Pardon. It is not the cauſe, but it is the</hi> condition, <hi>without which no remiſſion.</hi> Solomon <hi>would not ask pardon, but upon this</hi> condition, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 6.26, 27. <hi>nor does the Lord anſwer him, but upon the</hi> ſame terms, <hi>chap.</hi> 7.14.]</q> 
               <hi>In fine for underſtanding the matter he is there treating of, he deſires us to obſerve three Propoſitions;</hi> 
               <q>[1. Prop. <hi>All Sins are pardoned upon the firſt act of Faith and Repentance. — But tho' all</hi> be then pardoned, yet not all alike. <hi>Therefore obſerve</hi> (2.) <hi>Sins paſt and repented of, are pardoned</hi> abſolutely, <hi>becauſe the condition is preſent; and where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is preſent, that which</hi> was conditional <hi>becomes</hi> abſolute. (3.) <hi>Future Sins, or Sins unrepented of,</hi> are but pardoned <hi>to a Believer</hi> conditionally, <hi>becauſe the</hi> condition <hi>of Pardon,</hi> is not in being, is future; <hi>he has not yet repented for thoſe Sins,</hi> &amp;c.]</q> 
               <hi>Thus the Reverend, Learned and Pious Mr.</hi> Clarkſon. <hi>See what
<pb facs="tcp:93175:4"/>follows there immediately. His meaning is, That the wilful Sins which Believers fall into after Converſion, tho' at firſt Converſion they were pardoned</hi> virtually <hi>and</hi> conditionally, <hi>yet they are not pardoned</hi> formally <hi>and</hi> obſolutely; <hi>they are not</hi> actually <hi>pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> till <hi>the guilty Believer hath</hi> actually renewed his Faith and Repentance. <hi>Now theſe two worthy Miniſters of Chriſt, Dr.</hi> Owen <hi>and Mr.</hi> Clarkſon <hi>were no</hi> Amyraldians, <hi>and ſince we agree with them in this Point, and teach the ſame Doctrine which they taught before us; Mr.</hi> Goodwin <hi>in his</hi> Preface <hi>did very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently mention the oppoſition made to</hi> Amyrald <hi>in</hi> France,
<note place="margin">See the end of his <hi>Preface.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and it was not fair nor juſt to do it with a manifeſt deſign to make People believe that he dangerouſly erred in this Point, and we with him. For, to hold the Goſpel-Covenant to be a Law of Grace,</hi> in the ſenſe that we hold it ſo to be, <hi>was none of</hi> Amyralds <hi>ſingular or erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for which he was taxed by his Adverſaries beyond the Seas: Nay this is ſo far from being one of his ſingular Opinions, that it was</hi> common <hi>to his Adverſaries with him. And for ought I know to the contrary,</hi> they <hi>and</hi> he <hi>were</hi> all <hi>of one mind in believing the Goſpel-Covenant to be a</hi> Law of Grace, <hi>as aforeſaid.</hi> Some <hi>of them</hi> I know <hi>were, but whether they were all</hi> de facto <hi>agreed in this or not, (for I do not pretend to know them all), yet this is certain that if it be</hi> a revealed Truth, <hi>that the Goſpel-Covenant</hi> is a Law, <hi>a</hi> Law of Grace, eſpecially <hi>with reſpect to the Elect; all Chriſtians ought to agree to it, and to receive it with Faith and Love, notwithſtanding all Objections to the contrary. And now, that it is a</hi> revealed Truth, <hi>I think I have clearly proved in the following Remarks and Animadverſions on Mr.</hi> Goodwins <hi>Book, and have alſo Anſwered all his Objections against it. That my Proofs and Anſwers are good, ſolid and ſufficient, I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and firmly perſwaded in my own mind; yet I deſire no Man to believe it upon my bare word, but adviſe all Men who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and into whoſe hands my Book ſhall come, to read, conſider, and then judge of my Proofs and Anſwers, and believe (as they will anſwer to God) according to the evidence which I have offered for the Truth which I have aſſerted in this matter. I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely avoided imitating my Reverend Brothers declamatory way of Writing, becauſe it is not ſo good a way to clear up the Truth, and
<pb facs="tcp:93175:4"/>to inform the Judgment, as it is to engage the Affections to an Opinion or Party; and whether with or without Judgment, all is one to ſome whoſe deſign is only to</hi> make <hi>or</hi> ſtrengthen a Party. <hi>I ſincerely proteſt that I do not write for ſuch an end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I uſe no ſuch means.

            <head>Remarks on the First Chapter of Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi>'s Diſcourſe of the Goſpel.</head>
            <p>THIS Reverend Brother in his Firſt Chapter, Pages 4, 5. States the Controverſie, and in ſo doing; Firſt ſaith, <hi>That if by the Goſpels being a New Law, is meant a Doctrine of Grace newly revealed after the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works was broken, wherein God hath declared in what order and manner he will ſave guilty condemned Sinners, it is preſently granted, and the Controverſie is at end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That if he will grant, that God in the Goſpel hath <hi>not only declared</hi> the Order and Manner <hi>of his own acting</hi> in ſaving Sinners; but <hi>alſo</hi> that he hath <hi>declared and preſcribed to us, the Order and Manner of our acting,</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to his Grace, <hi>for obtaining</hi> our own Salvation through Chriſt; and likewiſe that the Order preſcribed to us, is a <hi>Conditional Order,</hi> with reſpect to the ſubſequent Bleſſings of the Covenant; then we declare <hi>here,</hi> as we did declare <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> in our Apology, that we mean no more by the Goſpels being <hi>a new Law of Grace.</hi> But he denyes that the Lord in the Goſpel hath preſcribed any Conditional Order to be obſerved by us. And therefore ſaith; <q>(Secondly,) <hi>What is denyed is this, That the Goſpel is a Law</hi> commanding new Precepts as Conditions of obtaining its Bleſſings, and Eſtabliſhed with a Sanction, promiſing Life and Happineſs to the obſervance of them, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the neglect.</q> 
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I know no Man that ever affirmed what this Reverend Brother here denyes. <hi>A Law commanding New Precepts,</hi> is a Phraſe peculiar to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and with my conſent, he ſhall have the <hi>honour</hi> of being the <hi>firſt Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Authour of it.</hi> For my part, though I have heard of a Law commanding new Duties, yet do I not remember that I have heard before of <hi>a Law commanding new Precepts;</hi> for Precept and Commandment being all one, <hi>a Law commanding new Precepts,</hi> is <hi>a Law commanding new Commandments.</hi> I thought the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves had not been the Object, or if you will, the ſubject matter of the Commandments themſelves; but that the Duties Commanded had been the Object or Subject matter of the Commandments. But we let that paſs, the thing which is moſt material, is that <hi>he imagines</hi> his Adverſaries do hold that <hi>the Precepts of the Goſpel Law, are the conditions of obtaining its Bleſſings.</hi> Now this is ſuch a <hi>wild</hi> fancy, that I doubt whether ever it came into a Mans head that was awake, and in the free exerciſe of his Reaſon; How then it comes to be in this Reverend Brothers Book, and that in the very ſtating of the Controverſie, I do not underſtand: But ſure I am, that I, nor any of my Reverend Brethren that I know, do not hold the Goſpel to be <hi>a Law in that ſenſe.</hi> We do with all our hearts joyn with Mr. <hi>Goodwin, in denying,</hi> that the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Goſpel <hi>are Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of obtaining its Bleſſings. What we ſay is, That God hath made <hi>the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Duties</hi> required by the Precepts of the Goſpel Law, to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obtaining its Subſequent Bleſſings; and that <hi>not for the ſake of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93175:6"/>or <hi>of the Duties performed,</hi> but <hi>for the ſake</hi> of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs according to the promiſe. Thirdly, In ſtating the Controverſie he denies that the Goſpel Law of Grace, or Covenant of Grace has any Sanction either promiſſory of Life and Happineſs unto thoſe who perform the condition, or minatory of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe who neglect it. Now here I muſt differ from him, and affirm what he denyes; But (1.) I affirm it with this difference between the promiſſory and minatory Sanction, That the Goſpel primarily and principally promiſeth its ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Bleſſings and Benefits to thoſe who perform its Condition; and doth but ſecondarily threaten Puniſhments againſt thoſe who neglect to perform it; deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to reſtrain Men from the ſin of not performing the Condition, and to bind them over to puniſhment only on ſuppoſition that they do not performe the condition. (2.) I affirm that though the Goſpel promiſe Life and Happineſs unto thoſe who perform its Condition, yet it doth not promiſe it <hi>preciſely for the</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance ſake, but <hi>only for the ſake of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs;</hi> as it threatens puniſhment unto thoſe who neglect to perform the Condition; and <hi>that for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neglect of performing it. Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <p>Some, I am afraid, will be apt to think that Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> ſtumbling on the Threſhold at his firſt ſetting out, and miſtating the Controverſie, is a bad <hi>Omen</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>Then in paſſing from his Firſt to his Second Chapter; he promiſes firſt to ſhew that it was little to my purpoſe to <hi>catch eagerly</hi> at the Word <hi>law,</hi> whereever I could meet with it in the Scripture, or in the Writings of Men. <hi>Anſw.</hi> By this it is plain he did not conſider nor underſtand what my purpoſe was. For it is as clear as the light at Noon day, that my purpoſe was to ſhew that the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> who charged us with <hi>Novelty</hi> in calling the Goſpel Covenant, <hi>a new Law of Grace</hi> was groſly miſtaken, and that in confidently affirming againſt us, that [<hi>New Law of Grace is a New Word, but of an Old and Ill meaning,</hi> he <hi>bore falſe Witneſs</hi> againſt his Brethren, and <hi>aſſerted a notorious falſehood in matter of Fact.</hi> This was my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deſign, as manifeſtly appears from the Apology. p. 24. And it being ſo, I appeal to all Men of common ſenſe and reaſon, if they have but common honeſty alſo, whether it was not very much to my purpoſe, to prove by Scripture, and by Teſtimonies of Ancient Orthodox Chriſtians, and Modern Proteſtant Divines, that <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> applyed to, and affirmed of the Goſpel or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, <hi>were not new words of an old and ill meaning.</hi> And yet <hi>I needed not eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to catch</hi> at the word <hi>Law,</hi> for it occurs ſo frequently in Ancient Writings, that a Man who reads them cannot avoid meeting with it; it offers it ſelf to him almoſt at every turn. And now Mr. G. joyns with us <hi>againſt our Accuſer,</hi> and doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove him to have been groſly miſtaken, by ſhewing that <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> is <hi>not a new word,</hi> but of an old ill meaning: On the contrary he demonſtrates it <hi>to be an old word,</hi> but pretends that <hi>now</hi> amongſt us, it hath <hi>a new and ill meaning.</hi> By <hi>this</hi> the People may ſee (if they will but open their Eyes) how well the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of our two Brethren againſt us, do agree; The firſt ſaith, that <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> is a <hi>New Word,</hi> of an old, but ill meaning; The <hi>Second</hi> who comes to defend him and enforce his Charge againſt us, ſaith that <hi>New Law of Grace</hi> is an <hi>Old Word</hi> of a <hi>New</hi> but <hi>Ill meaning.</hi> But it ſeems however contrary to one another their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies are, yet they muſt be both believed to be true againſt us: For neither of theſe Brethren will confeſs that they were mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>taken, and have done us wrong. No, they are both in the right; tho' the one ſay, That <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> is a <hi>New word</hi> of an old meaning; and the other ſaith, That it is an Old Word of a new meaning. But it may be, ſome will reply, That they both agree at leaſt that it is a word of an ill-meaning. <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, But (1.) For all that agreement, they yet
<pb facs="tcp:93175:6"/>refute one another. For the firſt Accuſer ſaith that the <hi>old meaning is ill;</hi> but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> maintains that the <hi>old meaning of the Word is good,</hi> and pretends that the <hi>new only is ill.</hi> (2.) If theſe two Brethren do not agree <hi>about the word it ſelf,</hi> whether it be <hi>old</hi> or <hi>new;</hi> but the one ſaith, it is <hi>new,</hi> and the other ſaith it is <hi>old,</hi> and therefore one of them muſt needs be miſtaken; we have more reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are miſtaken <hi>about the meaning of the word,</hi> and in ſaying, that is a word of an <hi>ill meaning;</hi> becauſe it is much more difficult to know what is the true or falſe, right or wrong meaning of a word, then to know the word it ſelf, whether it be lately invented, or hath been of very ancient uſage in the Chriſtian Church.</p>

            <head>Remarks on the Second Chapter.</head>
            <p>IN this Chapter he diſcourſeth of the various ſignification of the word <hi>Law,</hi> and affirms that the word <hi>Law</hi> in the Old Teſtament uſed for the Goſpel, ſignifies no more than <hi>a Doctrine,:</hi> To which I Anſwer, (1.) That I freely grant, and never yet denyed, that the word <hi>Law</hi> is capable of a various meaning, nor did I in the Apology from the <hi>bare ſound</hi> of the Word, abſtractly conſidered, ſo much as ſeem to argue for one particular determinate Senſe, excluſive of all others. I only ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 22. that our Brethren ſhould not <hi>diſlike our calling</hi> the Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>a Law,</hi> becauſe the Scriptures of Truth call it ſo expreſly. And this Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth now confeſs to be true. Likewiſe <hi>p.</hi> 24. from the Apoſtles calling it, <hi>the Law of Faith, Rom.</hi> 3.27. and ſaying that it is of Faith, <hi>that it might be by Grace, Rom.</hi> 4.16. I argue that he hath in <hi>effect,</hi> and <hi>by implication</hi> called it <hi>the Law of Grace.</hi> And that therefore we are no <hi>Innovators</hi> in calling it ſo after him. (2.) Mr. G. can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove that becauſe the word <hi>Law</hi> is of a various ſignification, and ſometimes ſignifies <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> that therefore when it is uſed for the Goſpel, it ſignifies nothing but a <hi>Speculative Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Narrative requiring no Faith nor Practice</hi> in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining pardon of Sin and Eternal Life through and for the alone Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. (3.) What he alledges out of <hi>Schindler</hi> and <hi>Cocceiut</hi> their <hi>Lexicons,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Torah,</hi> which is rendred <hi>Law,</hi> ſignifies any <hi>inſtruction given us, not only by the Precepts, but the Promiſes of God,</hi> is wholly impertinent, and makes nothing againſt me. For in my Judgment the <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> is <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> both by Precept and Promiſe. Hence I ſay in the Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 22. that it is a <hi>Covenant-Law, which makes rich offers of Grace, of Juſtifying and Glorifying Grace, &amp;c.</hi> And again a little after, that this Law of Grace is <hi>the Conditional part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace;</hi> it is that part of the Covenant of Grace, which reſpects the way of God's diſpenſing to us the ſubſequent Bleſſings and Benefits of the Covenant, <hi>ſuch as pardon of Sin and Eternal Salvation.</hi> —Briefly, <hi>As it is a Law of Grace to us:</hi> it is that part of the Covenant which <hi>preſcribes to us the Condition</hi> to be performed through Grace on our part; and which promiſes us Pardon and Life for Chriſt's ſake alone, when we through Grace perform the Condition; and therefore it muſt needs be <hi>very inſtructive</hi> both by <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Promiſe.</hi> (4.) What Mr. G. often ſays that the Goſpels being called <hi>a Law,</hi> ſignifies <hi>no more but that it is a Doctrine;</hi> I utterly deny it <hi>in his ſenſe</hi> of the word Doctrine; nor doth <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Horah,</hi> prove any ſuch thing. <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Hebrew</hi> as well as any Man in theſe latter Ages, tells us in his <hi>Lexicon, pag.</hi> 337. that the <hi>whole word of God</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:93175:7"/>if the <hi>whole Word of God</hi> be called <hi>a Law</hi> for that reaſon, then the <hi>Goſpel Covenant</hi> which is a <hi>principal part</hi> of the word of God, is called a Law <hi>for the ſame reaſon,</hi> to wit, becauſe <hi>it teacheth us Gods Will towards us, and our Duty towards God and our Neighbour.</hi> Accordingly it is freely granted that the Goſpel Govenant <hi>is a Doctrine,</hi> and a <hi>Doctrine of Grace;</hi> but withal, it is to be alwayes remembred, that it is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which <hi>not only</hi> promiſes gracious Benefits and Bleſſings on Gods part. but <hi>alſo requires a Condition to be performed and terms to be complyed with through Grace on our part.</hi> Hence the Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. ſaith, <hi>he [the Lord] will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> And proves what he had ſaid, <hi>by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> for out of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall go forth the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. G. confeſſes that by <hi>Law, here is meant</hi> the Goſpel; and then it follows that the Goſpel is a Doctrine which reacheth us the Lords ways, <hi>not only the ways wherein he walks with us;</hi> but <hi>alſo</hi> the ways and paths <hi>wherein we walk</hi> with him. Mr G would have the <hi>wayes</hi> which the Lord <hi>teacheth</hi> his People <hi>by the Goſpel,</hi> to be <hi>only the ways which the Lord himſelf walks in:</hi> He would have them to denote <hi>only the order</hi> which God hath conſtituted <hi>for himſelf</hi> to obſerve in juſtifying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But certainly that Interpretation is too ſhort, for the <hi>ways</hi> which God hath <hi>preſcribed unto us,</hi> to walk in; are called Gods ways in Scripture, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.) and he is alſo ſaid to teach them his People (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.11. and 119. <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33 <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 6.45.) and particularly he teacheth us that it is our <hi>Duty</hi> to believe in Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation. And <hi>as Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>way</hi> unto the Father, <hi>ſo Faith</hi> is the <hi>way</hi> unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This the <hi>Goſpel Law,</hi> the Law of Faith teacheth us, this Faith, it preſcribes to us, and requires of us. (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.31.); and conſequently the Goſpel in being ſaid to be <hi>a Law,</hi> it is ſaid to be <hi>ſuch a Doctrine as teacheth us the way we are to walk in ſuch a Doctrine as preſcribes to us ſome Means to be uſed and Condition to be performed by us brough Grace,</hi> that we may through Chriſt his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Interceſſion obtain the promiſed Bleſſings of Juſtification and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And this my Reverend Brother ſometimes hath Light to diſcern, and Freedom to confeſs <hi>in part,</hi> as in <hi>pag.</hi> 15. where he ſays, That <hi>according to the uſual Language</hi> of Gods word, <hi>to walk in Gods ways, is to obſerve his orders and appointments; the expreſſion here may denote no more than that they would punctually keep to the way of Salvation marked out by him, and ſeek to be juſtifyed no otherwiſe than by Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſs, as the Law or Doctrine of the Goſpel preſcribes.</hi> Thus he. Now (1.) Concerning <hi>this ſeeking</hi> to be juſtifyed by Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel preſcribes,</hi> I demand of Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> whether it be <hi>ſomething</hi> or <hi>nothing?</hi> If he ſay that it is <hi>nothing,</hi> Then (1.) The <hi>Law</hi> or Doctrine of the Goſpel preſcribes to us <hi>ſeeking,</hi> that is, <hi>it preſcribes nothing.</hi> And that is an <hi>odd way</hi> of preſcribing, to preſcribe, <hi>and yet to preſcribe nothing.</hi> (2) It is <hi>as odd a way of ſeeking,</hi> for to <hi>ſeek by doing nothing.</hi> But if to avoid this abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſay that <hi>ſeeking is ſomething;</hi> then I affirm that <hi>that ſomething,</hi> muſt be <hi>ſome Work or Act of the Soul:</hi> And if ſo, then we have what we deſire, to wit that <hi>the Goſpel is a Law.</hi> For he ſays that the <hi>Law or Doctrine</hi> of the Goſpel <hi>preſcribes ſeeking,</hi> and ſeeking <hi>is ſome Work or Act;</hi> therefore the <hi>Goſpel preſcribes ſome Work or Act.</hi> And what it preſcribes to us, <hi>unto that it obliges us,</hi> and ſo by neceſſary conſequence <hi>it is a Law</hi> that obliges us to Work and Act, and by that means to ſeek Juſtification by Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſs only. (2ly.) It is further to be obſerved, That the <hi>ſeeking</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel Law</hi> preſcribes, is very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as the word <hi>(ſeeking)</hi> is uſed in the Scriptures of Truth. It is a word that ſignifies <hi>the diligent uſe of the Means which the Lord hath appointed for obtaining the thing ſought.</hi> But ſo it is, that (as is proved in the Apology) the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Faith and Repentance to be means to be uſed on our part,</hi> for obtaining Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb facs="tcp:93175:7"/>by Chriſt's Blood and Righteouſneſs only. [Repentance is the means or condition <hi>diſpoſitive of the Subject</hi> (Man,) that he may be pardoned and juſtified by Faith in Chriſt's Blood, and Righteouſneſs only. And Faith is the only <hi>means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental,</hi> or <hi>Condition receptive and applicative of the object</hi> (Chriſt <hi>and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by and for which Object alone,</hi> Man is juſtified and pardoned.] And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel-Law by preſcribing the <hi>foreſaid ſeeking,</hi> which ſignifies the diligent uſe of all appointed means to the end before mentioned, <hi>it preſcribes the exerciſe of Faith and Repentance:</hi> And <hi>ſo the Goſpel is a Law</hi> in a very true and good ſenſe, and that ſenſe <hi>the ſame</hi> which we affirmed it to be in our Apology. Whence it appears that my Reverend Brother <hi>has here yielded the cauſe,</hi> and is come over to our Camp, and if he would be conſiſtent with himſelf, here might be an end of the Controverſie about the Goſpels being <hi>a Law</hi> with reſpect to Juſtification. For aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, we mean no more than that it preſcribes ſeeking by Faith and Repentance, and chiefly by Faith as aforeſaid. And this is the commonly received Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, as I proved in the Apology, and ſhall yet further prove it, if need be.</p>
            <p>But he objects up and down his book, that if the Goſpel Covenant did preſcribe or require any work or works whatſoever, and did oblige us to <hi>any Duty,</hi> then it would be another Law of Works, and we ſhould ſtill be juſtified by Works. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, By denying the Conſequence. Indeed it is true, That if the Goſpel require a Work or Duty, it requires a Work or Duty, for that is an Identical Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no reaſonable Man hath ſo little Wit as to deny the Truth of it. But it is utterly falſe, that if the Goſpel require any Works then <hi>it is another Law of Works, in the Scripture-Senſe</hi> of the Word. For by <hi>Law of Works,</hi> the Scripture always means <hi>ſuch a Law, or Covenant of Works as would juſtifie a Man by and for his Works, if he had them, as he ought to have had them.</hi> But though the Goſpel require of us ſome works, <hi>yet it is no Law of Works;</hi> for it doth not require any Works, that we may be <hi>juſtifyed either in whole or in part by, and for thoſe Works as ſuch.</hi> Nor are we <hi>for them in the leaſt juſtityed</hi> at the Bar of God. They are not any of them, <hi>the leaſt part of that Rigateouſneſs by and for which we are juſtifyed.</hi> This we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and explained to fully and clearly in our Apology, that we cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that any Chriſtian that is <hi>endued with Common Honeſty, and hath read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our ſaid Apology,</hi> ſhould perſiſt <hi>in accuſing us of holding Juſtification by Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or in aſſerting confidently that it follows by good conſequence from our Principles. That conſequence, my Reverend Brother can never prove: For though <hi>Repentance be a Work</hi> yet is it not (according to our Principles) <hi>required by the Evangelical Law, as a Work to Juſtifie us,</hi> or <hi>as a Work for which we are to be juſtifyed in the leaſt degree, but only as a means or condition in the Subject (Man) to diſpoſe and prepare him</hi> for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>by Faith only in Chriſt's Blood</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> And again, Though Faith be <hi>a Work in it ſelf,</hi> yet doth not the Evangelical Law require it as <hi>a Work to be a part of that Righteouſneſs by and for which we are juſtifyed; but it requires Faith only as the Inſtrumental Means, or Condition by which we receive and apply to our ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo truſt to Chriſt and his ſatisfactory meritorius Righteouſneſs, as that by, and for which alone we are Juſtifyed before Gods Tribunal.</hi> Let Mr. G. try when he will, he ſhall find it impoſſible to prove from my Principles, as I have here truely and ſincerely ſet them down, that the Goſpel would be <hi>another Law of Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and that <hi>we would be Justifyed by Works,</hi> if the Goſpel <hi>required Faith and Repentance as aforeſaid.</hi> I might with more appearance of reaſon prove from my R. B. Principle, That if Faith <hi>be required only by the Natural Moral Law,</hi> and if we be Juſtifyed by Faith, (as we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are,) and if Faith be a Work (as in its own Nature it certainly is;) <hi>then we are juſtifyed by a Work of the Natural Moral Law,</hi> and ſo are <hi>in tantum</hi> juſtifyed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93175:8"/>by the Law of Works; and look how he can anſwer this Argument drawn from his Principle; with as much facility (if not more) ſhall I anſwer his Sophiſme drawn from my Principle, That the Goſpel is <hi>a Law of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need ſay no more to anſwer all he brings in his Second Chapter, but to declare, that as he ſays <hi>pag.</hi> 12. That <hi>all but Papiſts, Socinians, and Arminians harmoniouſly agree in explaining ſuch places (as call the Goſpel a Law) after ſuch a manner, as may not give the leaſt colour to the Opinion of the Goſpels being a Law, in the ſenſe of the three mentioned Parties;</hi> ſo I do entirely agree with them in <hi>that manner</hi> of explaining them, and do with them utterly <hi>reject the</hi> Popiſh, Socinian, <hi>and</hi> Arminian <hi>Senſe of the Goſpels being a New Law.</hi> But then it follows not, that the Goſpel is no New Law <hi>in any Senſe,</hi> becauſe it is not one <hi>in the</hi> Popiſh, Socinian, <hi>and</hi> Arminian <hi>Senſe.</hi> Our Authour in <hi>pag.</hi> 10. ſays the Goſpel is called a <hi>Law, but no otherwiſe than as it is a comfortable inſtruction to poor convinced Sinners what riches of Mercy there are in ſtore, and as it teacheth them how they may truſt and hope in the God of all Grace.</hi> But this is not true <hi>in his Excluſive Senſe,</hi> for beſides that, <hi>it is a Law as it teacheth how</hi> ſuch Sinners <hi>ſhould</hi> (ex officio) <hi>in point of Duty, truſtand hope</hi> in the God of all Grace through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>In fine,</hi> Though in <hi>pag.</hi> 14. he mincingly ſay, That the word <hi>Judge,</hi> in <hi>Micah</hi> 4.3. <hi>may very well import no more, than that Chriſt will judge what courſe of Salvation is beſt for us to take, that he will determine the caſe; and it is better for us to acquieſce in the Deciſion of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nerring Judgment, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor will ever miſlead us, than to purſue our own miſtaken apprehenſions, which bewilder us continually:</hi> Yet <hi>even this</hi> will ſufficiently evince that the Supernatural Goſpel-Revelation of that Judgment and Determination of Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, is <hi>a Law to us;</hi> for as ſoon as it comes to our knowledge, it doth of it ſelf immediately oblige us to acquieſce in his Judgment and Determination, and to take that courſe for Salvation, which he hath judged beſt for us to take. So that let Mr. G. ſhuffle never ſo much, he will never be able to avoid his being obliged by the Doctrine of the Goſpel immediately to believe in Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. and to take that courſe which he hath preſcribed in order to Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. I ſhall conclude my Animadverſions on this Second Chapter, with the Judgment of the Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> (who was neither <hi>Papiſt, Socinian,</hi> nor <hi>Arminian</hi>) as it is expreſſed in his Annotation on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law. [The New Law, the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which is frequently called a Law, becauſe it hath the Nature and Power of a Law, obliging us no leſs to the Belief and Practice of it, than the Old Law did.]</hi>

            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter, he doth me a manifeſt wrong, in ſaying, <hi>That I concluded, (but with no certainty) from the Goſpels being called a Law in the New Teſtament, that it is a Rule of Works,</hi> &amp;c.)

And I am ſure that both <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Primaſius,</hi> Two Ancient Fathers, who in their Commentaries on <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 19. did <hi>that way</hi> interpret the words of <hi>Paul, I through the Law, am dead to the Law;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>I through the Evangelical Law, am dead to the Old Law;</hi> I ſay I am ſure that both of them by the Evangelical <hi>Law,</hi> underſtood ſuch a <hi>Goſpel-Law as hath not only Promiſes, but alſo hath its own Precepts and Threatnings;</hi> as manife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And having briefly hinted this, (That <hi>Jerome, Primaſius,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> who all Three go one way, and <hi>there</hi> think to have found <hi>the Evangelical Law,</hi> yet did not by the Evangelical Law underſtand <hi>a mere Speculative Doctrine or Narrative that requires nothing at all, neither Faith nor Repentance,</hi>) I might very well paſs over Mr. G's. fine flouriſh upon the Words of the Apoſtle, as not worth my taking any further notice of, had not he dropped ſeveral groſs falſehoods in giving his Senſe of that Text. As (1.) That the Error of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> againſt which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, was that they held the Goſpel to be <hi>a New Law,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 18.</note> in the ſame Senſe that we hold it ſo to be.</hi> This, I ſay, is a groſs falſehood, for it is manifeſt that thoſe <hi>Galathians</hi> were Judaizing Chriſtians, whoſe Error was, That Men cannot be Juſtifyed and Saved, unleſs over and beſides their believing in Chriſt, and repenting of their Sins; they be Circumciſed, and keep the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 21. and 5 <hi>ver.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

In <hi>Page</hi> 19, 20, 21, he all along inſinuates plainly, That we hold we are Juſtifyed <hi>in part</hi> by our own Works done in obedience to the New Goſpel Law, and that the defect of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is made up by the ſuper-addition of our own Righteouſneſs to his; ſo that we are Juſtifyed before Gods Tribunal not <hi>only</hi> by Chriſt's Imputed Righteouſneſs, but alſo <hi>in part by and for our own Works and Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is another falſehood ſo groſs, that I wonder my Reverend Brother ſhould ever be guilty of it, if he hath read and underſtood our Apology, <hi>pag,</hi> 38, 39, 40, 45, 80, 89, 90, 91, 193, 196, 200, 201. This Opinion which he would father upon us, we have in our Apology rejected, and do <hi>now here again reject it with abhorrency.</hi> And therefore it any do <hi>hereafter perſiſt to charge us with this Error</hi> which we <hi>abhor,</hi> let them look to it that <hi>they do not force us in our own juſt defence,</hi> to proclaim them to the World to be Men poſſeſs'ſt with a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating lying Spirit.

            <head>Remarks on the Fourth Chapter.</head>
            <p>IN this Chapter, at the very beginning, he miſtakes my purpoſe and deſign in appealing to the Fathers in this Controverſie, which was not, <hi>by them as Judges</hi> to prove any matter of right (as he pretends) but <hi>only by them as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to prove matter of Fact,</hi> to wit, That they called the Goſpel <hi>a Law</hi> in a good ſenſe,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 24.</note> and that therefore <hi>it is no new word of an Old but Ill meaning,</hi> as our Accuſer had affirmed it to be, and doth Mr. G. refute this? No, he is ſo far from refuting it, that he confirms the Truth of what I ſaid, and with me, proves the Accuſer of the Brethren to have aſſerted a notorious falſhood in matter of Fact, in the face of a Learned Age.</p>
            <p>Then he quotes <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Euſebius, Chryſoſtom, Origen, Theodoret</hi> with <hi>Photius,</hi> to ſhew that by <gap reason="foreign">

For (1.) I grant that <hi>the Law of the New Covenant</hi> (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> appoſitely calls it) is <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>a Doctrine of Grace,</hi> of the greateſt Grace that ever was, (as we told the World in the Apology, <hi>p</hi> 28. out of Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi>) yea, I grant and believe that it is <hi>a pure Doctrine of Grace,</hi> becauſe it both preſcribes and requires Purity, and likewiſe is a means through the influence of the Spirit of Grace, of effecting and working Purity in the Souls of Men: And moreover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Bleſſings and Benefits which it promiſes, are firſt promiſed of pure Grace,, and afterwards according to promiſe, are of pure free Grace given unto Men through Jeſus Chriſt. This I

               </gap>, <hi>Law,</hi> doth always ſignifie a Syſtem of Precepts and Commands, and ſo <hi>Origen</hi>'s Teſtimony makes nothing againſt me. (3.) I aſſent likewiſe to every thing he hath quoted out of <hi>Theoderet</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. And (4.) To all cited out of <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> on <hi>Pſal</hi> 49. And (5.) As for the Teſtimony of <hi>Photius,</hi> it is as the reſt impertinently alledged, and I am ſo for from oppoſing it, that on the contrary I have my ſelf upon the matter ſaid the ſame thing in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 201, and there ſhewed plainly in what ſenſe the <hi>Law</hi> is vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Believer, without being perfectly diſſolved; and ceaſeth without being diſannulled; and how Chriſt by fulfilling and performing it, hath entirely remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, <hi>ſo that</hi> it <hi>cannot poſſibly condemn a Penitent Believer, who walks not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Whereunto I now add that <hi>Photius there</hi> ſeems plainly to underſtand by <hi>Law,</hi> not the firſt Covenant of Works made with Man before, and broken by the fall of our Firſt Parents; but the Old Moſaical Covenant, or the Legal dark Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace under the Levitical Prieſthood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo the words of <hi>Photius</hi> do very fitly expreſs the Lords aboliſhing that <hi>legal dark way,</hi> and introducing <hi>the Evangelical clear way of Adminiſtring</hi> the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, which how it ſhould make againſt the Goſpels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a New Law of Grace,</hi> I do not comprehend:
<note place="margin">See <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6.</note> For to me it ſeems plainly to inſinuate the contrary, to wit, That the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>now in its New Chriſtian Conſtitution, and more gracious form of Adminiſtration,</hi> is indeed the <hi>new Law of Grace.</hi> (6ly, and <hi>Laſtly,</hi>) We come to <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> out of whoſe Writings, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> quotes two ſhort Sentences. As firſt, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Clemens,</hi> the Law is the <hi>Light of our way. Anſw.</hi> And what then, doth that militate againſt my Principle? Nothing leſs. For that I firmly believe, not becauſe <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith ſo, but becauſe the Holy Ghoſt ſaith ſo, as it is written, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. The Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is Light. It is confeſt then that the <hi>Law is the Light of our way,</hi> and ſo is the Goſpel too; yea, and the Goſpel is the greater Light of the two. And what can any reaſonable Man make of this to prove that the Goſpel is not a Law of Grace which hath its own Precepts? If the Goſpel hath its own Precepts will that hinder it from being the Light of our way? I think that in all reaſon, the contrary will follow, to wit, that if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Commandments of the Law be a Light of our way, as the Scripture ſays they are; that then the Precepts of the Goſpel (if it have any) are and muſt be alſo a Light of our way that directs and inſtructs us how we ought to walk <hi>now under the Chriſtian form of adminiſtring the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi> (2.)

And I hope he will not ſay that the definition of Mans Law, is the definition of Gods Law. (2.) If he ſay that it is the definition of God's Law; then according to Mr. <hi>Goodwin, Gods true and good opinion of a thing, is his Law:</hi> For the definition of a thing, and the thing defined are really and objectively the ſame; and differ only in the manner and form of expreſſion. Upon this I could move many queſtions that would puzzle my Reverend Brother to anſwer, and yet they are ſuch as ought to be anſwered and reſolved, upon ſuppoſition that <hi>Gods true and good opinion of a thing is his Law;</hi> but I will ſpare him, and only ask him this queſtion, Whether he holds that God is an <hi>Opinator,</hi> that he hath an Opinion of things, and knows them opinatively? If he deny, then how can Gods Opinion be his Law, if he have no Opinion and be no Opinator? If he affirm that God is an Opinator, that he hath an Opinion of things, and knows them opinatively? Then it will follow that Gods knowledge of things, at leaſt of the things which are the ſubject matter of his Laws, is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon <hi>probable Grounds and Motives,</hi> that it is accompanyed with a <hi>Fear</hi> of the contraryes being true; and that it's <hi>poſſible for him to be deceived.</hi> For theſe are the Natural Properties of an Opinion. (1.) It is founded upon a probable ground and motive. (2.) It is accompanyed with a fear of the contraries being true. (3.) <hi>Ei poteſt ſubeſſe falſom,</hi> though it be true, yet it is but contingently true, and ſo it might have been falſe, or may yet be falfe for any thing that can be certainly known to the contrary, from the probable Motive and Ground on which it is founded. And then the conſequence of this would be, that God is not infinitely Wiſe, Ommſcient and Infallible: And ſo upon Mr. G—'s own Principle of Gods being an <hi>Opinator,</hi> as well as upon the <hi>Arminians</hi> Principle; God might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be <hi>ſurprized</hi> (if not at the Arrival of new Colonies in Heaven, as his Expreſſion is in <hi>p.</hi> 1. of the Epiſtle to the Reader, yet) <hi>at many things which are done here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</hi> But I hope my R. Brother meant well, though his kind love to defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, hath dazled his ſight, and cauſed him to embrace a Phantoſme inſtead of his Beloved; I mean, cauſed him to take that for <hi>a definition of Gods Law,</hi> which is no definition at all; no, not a good deſcription of it. I inſiſt not therefore on this, but ſuppoſing his thoughts to have been ſound, I ſhall only adviſe him <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guam corrigere,</hi> to mend his Words, and not to be ſo fond of definitions for the future: And ſo I return to <hi>Clemens,</hi> concerning whom I ſay (1.) That <hi>he doth not ſay that a true and good Opinion of a thing is the definition of Gods Law,</hi> nor doth he <hi>there</hi> ſo much as ſay that it is a definition of Mans Law, or <hi>that it is a definition at all.</hi> (2.) What he ſaid of <hi>a Law</hi> in the general, he did not apply to the Goſpel, nor is it applicable to the Goſpel of Chriſt. If Mr. G— will needs be applying it, let him apply it to ſome other Goſpel, if he knows of any other; but he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have my conſent to apply it unto Chriſt's Goſpel, and thereby to make the Goſpel <hi>an Opinion.</hi> (3.)

For that the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a <hi>New Law of Grace,</hi> it is a Doctrine which was well known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the firſt Ages of Chriſt's Church, and which had its Original before the Birth of Antichriſt, and I am very well aſſured, will continue in Chriſt's Church, after the Period of that Man of Sin.</p>

            <head>Remarks on the Fifth Chapter.</head>
            <p>THIS Chapter is one intire Impertinency grounded upon the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Miſtake, That I framed an Argument from the ſound of the Word <hi>Law,</hi> to prove the Goſpel to be a Real Law that obliges to Duty. For, (1.) All that I argued from the Goſpels being <hi>called a Law</hi> in Scripture, was that the Brethren <hi>ſhould not be offended with us for calling it by that Name,</hi> ſince the Lord himſelf in Scripture had ſo called it. (2.) From its being called a Law both by the Fathers, and Orthodox Proteſtant Divines, I argued that it is <hi>not a new word</hi> of an old, but ill meaning. And in both reſpects my arguing was cloſe and conſequential. But for its being a Law that preſcribes to us, and obliges us to ſome Duties in order to Goſpel-ends and purpoſes, That, I ſaid plainly enough,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 22.33.</note> depends on the Conditionality of the Covenant of Grace, (for I affirmed it to be the conditional part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) and I proved the Covenant to be Conditional <hi>with reſpect to its ſubſequent Bleſſings and Benefits.</hi> So that this Controverſie, whether the Goſpel be a Law of Grace or not, reſolves it ſelf into the queſtion, Whether the Covenant of Grace be Conditional, and whether <hi>it requires of us any Duty,</hi> with reſpect to its ſubſequent Bleſſing and Benefits. And my Reverend Brother will never do any thing to purpoſe againſt me in this Controverſie, <hi>unleſs he ſolidly and effectually prove</hi> (what is impoſſible to be proved,) <hi>That the Covenant of Grace is not at all Conditional and that it doth not require any Duty of us at all, in the foreſaid reſpect.</hi> And if he do that, he doth his Work indeed; but till that be done, he doth nothing to any purpoſe, and all his labour is loſt. And particularly his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93175:11"/>is loſt in quoting <hi>Roman</hi> Authours, to wit, <hi>Iſodore, Paulus Merula, Briſonius, Juvenal, Ovid, Cicero, Papinian</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> to prove that the word [<hi>Lex, Law.</hi>] hath various ſignifications, For this is proving what was not at all denyed in the Apology; nor was any other thing concluded from the <hi>bare Word</hi> its being found in Scripture, and in Ancient Authours, but that <hi>we may uſe the Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt cauſe of offence,</hi> and that it is not <hi>a New Word</hi> of an old, but ill meaning.</p>
            <p>To as little purpoſe doth he quote <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> to ſhew, that by the word <hi>Law,</hi> they frequently mean <hi>no more than a Doctrine.</hi> For (1.) Suppoſe it were true that <hi>frequently</hi> they mean no more than a Doctrine <hi>in my Reverend Brothers Senſe,</hi> yet if they do <hi>ſometimes mean more by it,</hi> and particularly, <hi>If they mean more by it in the places cited by me,</hi> that is <hi>enough</hi> to my purpoſe. (2) If by [<hi>no more than a Doctrine</hi>] he underſtand, <hi>no more than an abſolute Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>no more than a mere ſpeculative Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Narrative</hi> that <hi>requires no Duty</hi> of us at all, no <hi>not ſo much as to believe in Chriſt,</hi> then I ſay that his Two Quotations out of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Augustin,</hi> do not prove that by the word <hi>Law,</hi> they there <hi>meant no more than a Doctrine in that Senſe.</hi> For (1.) By his own Confeſſion, <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 63. Epiſtle of <hi>Goulartius</hi> his Edition, calls our Saviours Inſtruction how to adminiſter the Lords Supper, an <hi>Evangelical Law,</hi> but I hope he dare not ſay that our Saviours Inſtruction how to adminiſter that Ordinance, was nothing but an Abſolute Promiſe, or a mere Speculative Doctrine that obligeth Chriſtians to no Duty. Nay <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf, as Quoted and Tranſlated by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſaid that he was to ſend Epiſtles to his Brethren, <hi>That the Evangelical</hi> Law, and <hi>the declared Doctrine of our Lord, might be obſerved, and that the Brethren might not depart from what Christ had taught and practiſed.</hi> This Evangelical Law then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Bleſſed <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is <hi>a Doctrine that was to be Obſerved and Practiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Institution and Example:</hi> And conſequently it was a poſitive Law that obliged to Duty.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) For <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> if he tells us (as Mr. G. ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 27. of his Diſcourſe) that by the word Law, we may apprehend, <hi>not merely a Statute, but any other Doctrine; becauſe he styles not only the Five Books of</hi> Moſes, <hi>but the Prophets (in whoſe Writings there are ſo many gracious Promiſes of the Goſpel) by that Name.</hi> I anſwer, That makes nothing againſt me. For (1.) When I called the Goſpel <hi>a Law,</hi> I never meant a <hi>mere Statute</hi> excluſive of Gracious Promiſes; ſo far was I from ſuch a meaning, that I ſaid <hi>expreſly</hi> it is the Conditional part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.

                  <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 22.</note> That is, it is that part which preſcribes the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and graciouſly promiſes a Benefit for Chriſt's ſake to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of the Condition. Again I ſaid expreſly in <hi>page</hi> 33. that the Conditional Promiſe of Eternal Life to the Believer; together with the preſcription of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Lively Faith, is the very thing which Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and we after him, call <hi>the</hi> Law, according to which God proceeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2) If the Prophets are ſtyled by the Name <hi>of Law,</hi> in whoſe Writings are ſo many gracious Promiſes of the Goſpel, together with Precepts obliging the Duty; then may the Goſpel it ſelf, without offence, be termed <hi>a Law,</hi> in which there are both Gracious Promiſes, and Excellent Precepts. Yet (3dly.) It is incumbent upon Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to prove that in <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Judgment, or that in real Truth, the Prophets are called by the Name <hi>of Law, preciſely</hi> becauſe there are gracious Promiſes in them, and not at all becauſe there are many Excellent Divine Precepts in them. Are there not Gracious Promiſes of the Goſpel to be ſound in the Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet I trow, thoſe Five Books are not called the Law preciſely, becauſe of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Promiſes that are in them, and not becauſe they contain the whole Sum
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93175:11"/>of Legal Precepts given by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the People of <hi>Iſrael. Augustin</hi> in his Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and laſt Book of the Trinity, takes occaſion from what he had ſaid of Gods being called (<hi>Love</hi>) 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. to ſpeak of the various acceptation of the word <hi>Law,</hi> and ſays that ſometimes it is taken more generally for all the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, or for the Prophets or Pſalms, and ſometimes more ſpecially and properly for the Law given at <hi>Sinai.</hi> Now this doth not in the leaſt militate againſt any thing I have ſaid in the Apology. For I can grant with <hi>Augustin,</hi> that the word <hi>Law</hi> is ſometimes uſed in a more general comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Senſe, and at other times in a more ſpecial reſtrained Senſe; and yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtently enough, hold that the Goſpel is called a Law in Scripture, and that it is a Law of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly ſhewed, that this whole Chapter is Impertinent. But though there be nothing in it to his purpoſe againſt me, yet there is ſomething in it to my purpoſe againſt him, For <hi>page</hi> 26, 27. of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he tells us, That <hi>a Law is a Doctrine,
<note place="margin">See alſo his <hi>Serm.</hi> on the <hi>Q.</hi> Death. p. 7, 8.</note> which teacheth us what is best for us to do, if we will be taught by the Counſel of thoſe who are wiſer than our ſelves.</hi> And <hi>in this ſenſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will eaſily grant the Goſpel to be a</hi> Law; <hi>for it is the inſtruction of God, (whoſe Wiſdom is beyond all denyal; infinitely ſuperiour to ours,) to our periſhing Souls,</hi> &amp;c. Now if the Goſpel be <hi>a Law in this ſenſe,</hi> then certainly it is a <hi>Practical Doctrine</hi> that obligeth us to Duty. Doth not the Infinitely wiſe God his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting us to believe in Chriſt for Juſtification, oblige our Conſciences to believe in him, and hath it not the force and effect of a Law? I bleſs God, I own its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging force, and it is, and I hope ever ſhall be <hi>a Law to me,</hi> a Gracious Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Law. And I hope my R. Brother will in time do ſo likewiſe; Since he ſaith, that thrice Bleſſed is that Perſon whom Gods Enlightning Grace hath made ſo wiſe as to follow it.</p>

               <p>FOR the better clearing up of the matter in Controverſie, and ſcattering of the Miſt which my R.

And,</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93175:12"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be conſidered that the word <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſignifying good or glad tydings, it may be applyed to, and affirmed of ſeveral parts of Supernatural Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As, (1.) God's Eternal Decree to ſave for Chriſt's ſake a Select Number of loſt Sinners of Mankind, <hi>as revealed in the Scriptures of Truth,</hi> is <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for it is <hi>good and glad tydings</hi> to the viſible Church. (2.) The abſolute Prophecy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to ſend Chriſt into the World to redeem Man, and to ſeek and ſave that which is loſt, is Goſpel alſo, for it is good and glad tydings: The like I ſay of Chriſt's being actually come into the World. (3.) The Abſolute Promiſe to take away the Heart of Stone, and to give an Heart of Fleſh, to <hi>give the</hi> Redeemed, Saving Faith and Repentance, is Goſpel alſo, ſince it is good and glad Tydings. Now we never ſaid that the Goſpel in any of theſe Three Senſes, is a Law commanding us to do any Duty, or perform any Condition. But, (4.) The word <hi>Goſpel</hi> in a more large, and comprehenſive Senſe, is taken for the Intire Covenant of Grace which God hath made with his Church through the Mediator, his Son, our Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt. In which Senſe it comprehends the Abſolute and Conditional Promiſes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the preſcription of the Condition, to the performers of which, the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promiſes were made on the account of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. Now <hi>it is in this ſenſe</hi> that we ſay the Goſpel taken for the Covenant of Grace, is <hi>a Law of Grace;</hi> It is a <hi>Law,</hi> as it preſcribes the Condition, and obliges us to compliance therewith, and <hi>it is a Law of Grace,</hi> as it promiſes to penitent Believers moſt gracious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Bleſſings; and likewiſe <hi>as it promiſes to the Elect,</hi> Special, Effectual, and Victorious Grace, whereby they do <hi>moſt freely,</hi> and <hi>yet moſt certainly,</hi> Believe and Repent. And that <hi>in this ſenſe,</hi> the Goſpel is ſo a Doctrine of Grace, as to be <hi>alſo a Law of Grace,</hi> that <hi>requires</hi> ſomething <hi>to be done by us</hi> through Grace, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Aſſemblies Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Art.</hi> 3. where it ſays <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,</hi> 
                  <q>That in the Covenant of Grace, the Lord freely offered unto Sinners Life and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>requiring of them Faith in him,</hi> that they may be ſaved, and promiſing to give unto all thoſe that are ordained to Life, his Holy Spirit to make them willing and able to believe.</q> And no leſs evident it is from the larger Catechiſme, where to the queſtion, <q>How is the Grace of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Second Covenant? It anſwers, That the Grace of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Second Covenant, in that he freely provideth and offereth to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners a Mediator, and Life and Salvation by him, and <hi>requiring Faith as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> to Intereſt them in him, promiſeth and giveth his Holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Art.</hi> 8. ſaith, <q>That the Doctrine of Predeſtination affords matter of Praiſe, Reverence and Admiration of God, and of Humility, Diligence and abundant Conſolation to all that <hi>ſincerely obey the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </q> Accordingly the Lord himſelf in the Scriptures of Truth, aſſures us that Unbelievers and Wicked Men, to whom the Word is Preached, do not obey the Goſpel, and that they ſhall be Damned for not obeying it. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. the Apoſtle proves their diſobedience to the Goſpel from their Unbelief, as the Effect from the Cauſe. See alſo 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. from all which it is evident, that the Goſpel in the ſenſe aforeſaid is <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> to the People of God: And I hope my R— Brother will not be ſuch an Unbeliever as to refuſe its being <hi>a Law of Grace</hi> to him alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is to be conſidered that there is a difference to be put between <hi>an accurate perfect Definition</hi> of a thing, which doth indeed contain <hi>whatever is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to the thing defined; and <hi>a Popular Deſcription of a thing,</hi> which yet in a large Senſe may be called a definition, but then it is acknowledged to be <hi>(definitio imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta, &amp; oratorum propria)</hi> An imperfect definition, and ſuch as is proper for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to make uſe of; and accordingly my R— Brother, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. <hi>lin.</hi> 8. hath theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93175:12"/>numerical words as ſignifying the ſame thing [<hi>when they profeſſedly define or deſcribe the Goſpel.</hi>] Now it is not neceſſary that a <hi>popular definition or deſcription,</hi> ſhould <hi>alwayes contain every thing that is eſſential</hi> unto that which is ſo defined or deſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is to be conſidered that the Goſpel taken in a limited reſtrained ſenſe, for one part of ſupernatural Revealed Religion, may be, and indeed <hi>ought to be</hi> defined or deſcribed one way; but taken in a more large comprehenſive Senſe for another, or more parts of Supernatural Revealed Religion; As for inſtance, For the Covenant made with the Church through Chriſt the Mediator, it may be, and indeed ought to be defined or deſcribed another way; ſo that what is not Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it, taken in a limited reſtrained Senſe, yet may be, and is Eſſential to it, taken in a more large and comprehenſive Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is to be well conſidered, and carefully remembred that when our <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> deny the Goſpel to be <hi>a Law</hi> (as they frequently do.) It is <hi>in the Popiſh, Socinian,</hi> or <hi>Arminian Senſe;</hi> and it is <hi>moſtly</hi> in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Senſe; for it was with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for the moſt part, that they had to do, when they denyed the Goſpel to <hi>be a Law.</hi> For inſtance, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book againſt the Papiſts <hi>(de Chriſto gratis Juſtificante)</hi> denyes the Goſpel to be a <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>their ſenſe,</hi> as <hi>we alſo do;</hi> and yet (as was ſhewed in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 96.128.) he maintain'd that Faith is <hi>the proper Condition</hi> of Juſtification, and that Evangelical Repentance is <hi>a Condition</hi> preparatory and diſpoſitive of the Subject to be juſtified, which is ſufficient to ſhow, That though he denyed the Goſpel to be <hi>a Law</hi> in the <hi>Popiſh Senſe,</hi> yet he did in effect hold it to be <hi>a Law of Grace in our Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is to be conſidered hat there is a vaſt difference between a <hi>Law of Works and a Law of Grace.</hi> For according to the <hi>Scriptural Senſe</hi> of the <hi>word, a Law of Works,</hi> is a <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>obſervance and keeping</hi> of which, is a mans <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Righteouſneſs,</hi> it is the Righteouſneſs <hi>by and for which</hi> he is Juſtifyed at the Bar of Gods governing Juſtice. But a <hi>Law of Grace</hi> is not ſuch, our <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>the Law of Grace,</hi> is <hi>not our Juſtifying Righteouſneſs</hi> at the Bar of Gods Juſtice, either in part, or in whole. It is only either (1.) That whereby we are <hi>diſpoſed</hi> for being Juſtifyed by Faith in Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs <hi>only,</hi> ſuch as is Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Repentance. Or, (2.) It is that whereby we receive, apply, and truſt to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>by and for which alone,</hi> we are Juſtifyed at the Bar of God's Juſtice, ſuch as is true Faith <hi>only.</hi> Or. (3.) It is that whereby we are <hi>qualified and diſpoſed</hi> for the <hi>actual poſſeſſion</hi> of that Eternal Glory and Happyneſs, which we received a Right unto <hi>before</hi> in our Juſtification, and which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after this Life is given to us in the full poſſeſſion (as to the Soul) for the ſake of Chriſt's Meritorious Righteouſneſs only, ſuch as is ſincere Evangelical Obedience. Now though we believe the Goſpel to be <hi>a Law of Grace</hi> which obliges us to Faith, Repentance, and ſincere Obedience, as means in order to the ends aforeſaid; yet we utterly deny that it is a <hi>Law of Works,</hi> nor doth it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from our Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is to be conſidered, that we ought to diſtinguiſh between the Moral Natural Law, and meer poſitive Laws. Now it is granted by us all, That the Lord after his Incarnation, did not give unto his People a <hi>New Moral Natural Law,</hi> nor did he <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>fill up the defects</hi> of the Old Moral Natural Law, neither did he enlarge the obligation of it, ſo as to make it oblige People to ſome Moral Natural Duties, which it obliged no Body unto under the Old Teſtament. <hi>In this ſenſe, Papiſts, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> hold Chriſt to have been <hi>a New Law giver;</hi> but this Opinion we all reject as falſe and abſurd, and as reflecting on God's Moral Law, as if it had been imperfect before. Whereas in truth Gods Moral Natural Law was alwayes moſt perfect in its kind, and obliged to all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93175:13"/>Moral Natural Duties, even unto the higheſt degree of ſinleſs perfection. And therefore what Chriſt did with reſpect to the ſaid Moral Law, was to fulfil it moſt perfectly in his Life, to explain it by his Doctrine, to clear up the true and full meaning of it, and to vindicate it from the falſe gloſſes of the Phariſaical Jews; to ſuffer and ſatisfie God's Juſtice for his Peoples breach of it: And to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, explained as aforeſaid, on his own Diſciples and Followers, as the Rule and Law of their Moral Natural Allegiance and Obedience unto God.</p>
               <p>But then for <hi>mere Poſitive Laws,</hi> as before his Incarnation he had given ſome ſuch unto his Church, ſo after his Incarnation, (the old Poſitive Laws being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated) he gave unto his Church ſome new poſitive Laws, ſuch as thoſe that relate to the Two Sacraments, the firſt day of the Week as the Chriſtian Sabbath, and the Order and Diſcipline that is to be obſerved in his Church under the New Teſtament. And though it is freely granted by us, that when ſuch Poſitive Laws are once enacted by our Lords Royal Authority, the Moral Natural Law it ſelf doth oblige us to obey them; yet we are firſt in order of Nature obliged to give Obedience to them by the Inſtitution of them, and by the Soveraign Authority which doth inſtitute and enact them: And the Law of Nature <hi>by it ſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> would <hi>never make them Laws,</hi> nor <hi>oblige us to do the things</hi> which are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of them; if they were not <hi>firſt made Laws</hi> by <hi>a new exertion</hi> of the Lords Legiſlative Power, which doth by thoſe poſitive Laws themſelves, <hi>firſt and immediately</hi> oblige us to obey them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Conſider that we ought to diſtinguiſh between a Laws being Old, or New, <hi>Quoad ipſam rei materiam &amp; ſubſtantiam, aut quoad rei modum &amp; circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam)</hi> in regard of matter and ſubſtance, or in regard of manner and circumſtance. Thus the Moral Command to love the Brethren, is both Old and New in different reſpects. It's <hi>Old</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>matter and ſubſtance;</hi> and yet it is <hi>New</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>ſpecial manner of</hi> loving the Brethren, <hi>as Chriſt loved us.</hi> Witneſs <hi>John</hi> 13.34. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.7, 8. So likewiſe the Poſitive Command to believe in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is both Old and New in reſpect of different Circumſtances of time. It is <hi>old,</hi> even as old as the firſt Promiſe after the fall. <hi>Gen</hi> 3.15. as it had reſpect unto Chriſt to come: But it is new as it hath reſpect unto Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and Crucified, Dead and Buried, Riſen from the Dead, Aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and there moſt highly dignifyed and glorifyed. For no Man under the Old Teſtament was obliged, or could be obliged to believe in Chriſt under this conſideration. But now we are all, to whom the Goſpel is Preached, ind ſp n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably obliged thus to believe on him. In like manner though the poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to believe in the Meſſiah, be as old as the firſt promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. yet the Command to believe that the Man <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is new, and could not be ſo old.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Conſider that we ſhould diſtinguiſh between a Law that hath only Legal Promiſes, without any promiſe of Mercy and Grace in it at all; and a <hi>Law</hi> that hath all Merciful and Gracious Promiſes belonging to it, and thoſe many great and precious. Now the firſt Covenant of Works <hi>is a Law</hi> that hath only Legal Promiſes, without any Promiſe of Mercy, or of renewing and pardoning Grace in it at all; It is a <hi>Law</hi> that required perſonal, perpetual and ever-ſinleſs Obedience; and promiſed Life to Man on Condition of ſuch Obedience, and for ſuch Obedience only would have Juſtifyed him; and therefore it is called the Law of Works. But the Covenant of Grace is a <hi>Law</hi> that hath all merciful and gracious Promiſes belonging to it, and thoſe many, great, and precious; and therefore it is rightly called the Law of Grace. And with reſpect to the Elect who are the <hi>moſt proper</hi> ſubjects of it <hi>as a Law of Grace,</hi> its predominant is Grace. Grace
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93175:13"/>runs through it all, and appears in all the parts of it. (1.) There is Grace in the mandatory part of it, in that part of it which preſcribes its Condition; in that <hi>legal, ever finleſs</hi> perfection is not <hi>rigidly</hi> inſiſted on; but Evangelical ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the performance of it is required as a Condition; which alſo is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted through Chriſt, and the ſinful defect thereof, together with all other ſin, is freely forgiven for Chriſt's ſake. (2.) There is Grace, Rich and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Grace in the promiſſory part of it, in that it promiſes to the Elect ſpecial Effectual Victorious Grace to cauſe them freely, yet certainly perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in Goſpel ſincerity; And in that when they through Grace perform the Condition, it further promiſes them moſt Gracious Benefits and Glorious Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and all through and for Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. (3.) There is Grace alſo in the very minatory Sanction, for the deſign of the Threatning, is not to bring on Men the Puniſhment threatned; but to curb the Fleſh in them, and to reſtrain them from thoſe Sins, which their own corrupt Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them unto, and which the Devil and the World tempt them unto. So that the very threatning is uſeful to them, and it is a Mercy to them, even to ſuch as the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> that they are under that conditional threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye. And ſince Grace doth thus appear in all the parts of it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Heb.</hi> 12.25.</note> it is very fitly called the Law of Grace; yea I do not refuſe to joyn heartily with my R. Brother in calling it <hi>a Doctrine of Grace;</hi> but withal I muſt declare that I do not at all like it the worſe, nor is it unto me the leſs gracious, becauſe <hi>it preſcribes unto me,</hi> ſomething <hi>to be done by me</hi> through my Lords Grace: But I like it the better for that, ſince it doth not in the leaſt detract from the Grace of it. Now if the Premiſſes be duely conſidered, and if the foreſaid diſtinctions be rightly applyed as there may be occaſion, it will be eaſie thereby to Anſwer all his Teſtimonies from Reformed, Proteſtant Divines.</p>

I Anſwer thereunto in general, that if that be all they prove, I profeſs ſincerely in a true and ſound Senſe to believe the ſame thing, to wit, that the Goſpel is a pure Doctrine of Grace, as I have ſaid and explained it before. From whence it doth not follow by any good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that it is not alſo <hi>a Law of Grace</hi> which requires of us Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſincere Obedience.

               <p n="1">(1.) That this is ſo far from beng a perfect definition, that it is no accurate Deſcription of the Goſpel. For here is no mention of the promiſe to give a New Heart, and to work Faith and Repentance in the Elect, which is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Goſpel. Witneſs <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10.

For in his Common places he ſo defines juſtifying Faith, as to make <hi>ſuch aſſurance</hi> to be <hi>but the immediate conſequent effect of it;</hi> whereas he places the eſſence of it in a firm certain aſſent to the general Promiſe, a Cordial recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt, and truſting in him for Juſtification according to the Promiſe.

And it is a Truſt in the Mercy of God promiſed for Chriſt the Mediators ſake. For truſt is a motion in the Will, neceſſarily anſwering unto aſſent. Faith alſo is a Vertue apprehending and applying the Promiſes, and quieting hearts.</hi>] Here we ſee <hi>Melancthon</hi> held the Faith by which we are Juſtifyed to be an <hi>actual,</hi> and not <hi>meerly an habitual or ſeminal Faith,</hi> and he judiciouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes three acts to it, (as alſo doth our own Confeſſion of Faith,) wherein he comprehends the whole Nature of Actual Faith. (1.) An Act whereby we aſſent unto the whole Word of God, eſpecially to the Goſpel-promiſe of free Juſtification through Chriſt. (2.) An Act whereby we receive and apply the Promiſe, and God's Mercy through Chriſt therein. (3) An Act whereby we truſt to the Promiſe, and to Gods Mercy through Chriſt therein. And then the <hi>effect</hi> of all, is, that thereby <hi>it quiets our hearts.</hi> Whence I infer that to make this definition of Faith conſiſtent with the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, by [<hi>the believing</hi> (aforeſaid) <hi>that they are received into favour for Chriſt's ſake</hi>] muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a believing that there is no other way to be received into favour, but for Chriſt's ſake; and therefore that Chriſt is to be received and truſted in only, for that end. Without this favourable interpretation, that <hi>Auſhurgh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as cited by my R. Brother, will be found to contradict our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, which is more exact and perfect: And even to contradict <hi>Melancthon</hi> himſelf, who was the firſt Compiler of the ſaid <hi>Auſburgh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If my R. Brother had duely conſidered what in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 88, 89. I quoted at large out of the 20th. Article of that <hi>Auſburgh</hi> Confeſſion, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93175:14"/>was certainly ſubſcribed both by <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and I think by moſt of our firſt Reformers beyond the Seas; he might have been aſhamed to have quoted that Confeſſion againſt me in this Controverſie. For <hi>there</hi> it ſays <hi>expreſly,</hi> (1.) That the Goſpel requires Repentance, (2.) That the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Grace is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, as</hi> the preaching of Repentance is Univerſal. And (3.) That the Goſpel Commands all to believe and receive the benefit of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now here my Reverend Brothers whole Book, is confuted by the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In the ſecond place he quotes <hi>Melancthons</hi> Apology for the ſaid Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and makes him deſcribe the Goſpel to be properly <hi>the promiſe of pardon of ſins, and of Juſtification on Chriſts account.</hi> To which I anſwer that this is a very lame, imperfect deſcription of the Goſpel. It is indeed properly <hi>a part,</hi> but it is far from being <hi>the whole</hi> of the Goſpel. The promiſe of taking away the heart of Stone, and giving an heart of Fleſh, with the gift of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the Promiſes of other things alſo, are proper parts of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In the third place, he quotes <hi>Luthers</hi> little Treatiſe of Chriſtian Liberty,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 29.</note> and tells us that there <hi>Luther divides the whole Word of God into two parts,</hi> to wit, <hi>into Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and the Precepts he entitles purely to the Law;</hi> but <hi>defines the Goſpel to be the other part of Gods word,</hi> and ſo <hi>to be only a complete Syſteme of Gracious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And then he cites the expreſs words of <hi>Luther,</hi> which are as followeth, [<hi>Therefore the Promiſes of God belong to the New Teſtament, yes, and are the New Teſtament.</hi>] I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if <hi>Luther</hi> (as Mr. G. ſaith) did there divide the <hi>whole word of God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two parts, to wit, <hi>Precepts and Promiſes;</hi> and entitled <hi>all the Precepts purely to the Law;</hi> and referred <hi>all Promiſes to the Goſpel;</hi> then it is as clear as the Light at Noon day, that he was miſtaken, and that his diviſion of the <hi>whole Word of God</hi> into thoſe two parts, was <hi>very lame and defective,</hi> for in the word of God, beſides Precepts and Promiſes, there are (1.) Hiſtories. (2.) Prophecies. (3.) <hi>Myſterious Doctrines.</hi> (4.) Threatnings, which <hi>as ſuch</hi> are neither Precepts nor Promiſes. (5.) Beſides Evangelical Promiſes, there are in the Word of God, <hi>meer Legal Promiſes</hi> which muſt belong to the Law, and cannot properly belong to the Goſpel. And my R. Brother doth himſelf in the ſame <hi>page</hi> 29. cite <hi>Melancthon</hi> diſtinguiſhing between gratuitous Promiſes, or Promiſes of Grace; and Promiſes that are not gratuitous or of Grace. Now if there be in the Word of God, Promiſes that are not of Grace, ſurely they muſt belong to the Law, and not to the Goſpel, if (as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> holds) the Goſpel be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>a pure Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>meer Promiſe or Promiſes of Grace.</hi> (2dly.) I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That though <hi>Luther</hi> doth indeed ſay that <hi>the Promiſes of God belong to the New Teſtament, yea, are the New Teſtament.</hi> Yet it is obſervable, that (1.) He doth not ſay that <hi>all the Promiſes of God</hi> belong to the New Teſtament. (2.) He doth not ſay that the Promiſes are <hi>the whole</hi> of the New Teſtament. I freely grant that the <hi>Evangelical Promiſes</hi> are the New Teſtament; that is, <hi>They are the New Teſtament in part:</hi> And <hi>they are a Principal part of it too.</hi> But what then? <hi>Ergo</hi> they are the whole New Teſtament. I utterly deny that conſequence, and I know Mr. <hi>G.</hi> cannot prove it to Eternity; nor doth <hi>Luther</hi> affirm it. So far was <hi>Luther</hi> from affirming it <hi>there,</hi> That in the ſame place a little before the words quoted by Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> he ſays expreſly as followeth.</p>

Set aſide the gloſſes of Mr. G—, and <hi>Melancthons</hi> own words do not prejudice my Cauſe at all. And <hi>elſewhere Melancthon</hi> is clearly for me, and holds, as I do, That the Goſpel <hi>properly</hi> taken, requires of us Faith and Repentance, and promiſes Grace to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to believe and repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I deſire no more to prove the Goſpel to be

                  <hi>a Law of Grace</hi> in our ſenſe of the word. This I ſhall (if the Lord will) clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove from <hi>Melancthons</hi> own words, in my Animadverſions on Mr. G—'s Seventh Chapter; and then it will plainly appear <hi>that he</hi> doth but abuſe <hi>Melancthon</hi> and the People too, in thus indeavouring to make them believe, that <hi>Melancthon</hi> was of his abſurd Opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) His next Witneſs againſt me is the famous <hi>Calvin,</hi> but I fear no harm from him; for I take him to be an honeſter Man than to contradict himſelf in Witneſs-bearing: And I am ſure he hath already borne Witneſs for us in the Apology, and declared that he believed (as we do) that the Goſpel-Covenant is Conditional, and requires of Men both Faith and Repentance in order to the Pardon of their Sins and Salvation of their Souls, (See <hi>Apol. pag.</hi> 51.92, 93, 94;) which is ſufficient to prove that he held the Goſpel to be a Law of Grace, as we do. And in the place which my R. Brother refers to, and in the words which he quotes, there is nothing but what is well conſiſtent with what I moſt truely and faithfully cited both out of his Inſtitutions and Commentaries. And indeed what is here quoted by Mr. G. is very impertinently alledged againſt me. For I do ſincerely confeſs that to inveſt Chriſt with a new Legiſlative Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and to dignifie the Goſpel with the title of a New Law, <hi>in the Popiſh Senſe of the Word,</hi> is indeed <hi>a mere fiction,</hi> and that thoſe who <hi>go the Popiſh way,</hi> have feigned Chriſt to be the Maker of an Evangelical Law, which ſhould have <hi>ſupplyed the defect even of the Moral Law</hi> given unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But notwithſtanding this, it is as clear as the Light, That <hi>Calvin</hi> did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel-Covenant to be nothing but a bundle of mere abſolute Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Grace: For beſides what was quoted in the <hi>Apology, Calvin</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the Third of <hi>Jonah,</hi> ſaith as followeth.

               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>Beza</hi> is brought to Witneſs againſt us, but to as little purpoſe; for I demonſtrated from <hi>Beza</hi> his own expreſs words in the Apology that he believed there is a Conditional Goſpel-Covenant; that Faith in Chriſt is the only recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive applicative Condition; and yet that true Repentance is required as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably neceſſary in grown Perſons, in order to pardon of Sin. And here I muſt rectifie what I ſaid in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 95. That <hi>it may be,</hi> and <hi>it would ſeem</hi> that <hi>Beza</hi> had ſome peculiar conceit, <hi>That all Repentance of what kind ſoever,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93175:16"/>is properly from the Law,</hi> and but improperly from the Goſpel, becauſe he ſaid in his 20th. Epiſtle, That <hi>Contrition did not proporly proceed from the Goſpel.</hi> Now I confeſs that in ſo underſtanding <hi>Beza</hi> there, <hi>I miſtook</hi> his true meaning <hi>to my own diſadvantage;</hi> and my miſtake aroſe from the word <hi>Contrition,</hi> by which <hi>Beza</hi> meant nothing but what <hi>the Papiſts</hi> ordinarily call by the name of <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> and that is a <hi>Legal Repentance,</hi> which as <hi>Beza</hi> rightly obſerved, proceeds <hi>not properly from the Goſpel,</hi> but <hi>from the Law.</hi> But I thought that by the word <hi>Contrition,</hi> he had meant what we commonly call <hi>Contrition</hi> from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17. and which is a true Evangelical Repentance enjoyned by the Goſpel. But ſince I have learned from his other Writings that by the word <hi>Contrition</hi> he meant not an Evangelical, but a <hi>Legal Repentance,</hi> when <hi>in the latter part of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> he ſaid that <hi>Contrition is not properly from the Goſpel,</hi> but from the Law; and by thus rightly underſtanding <hi>Beza,</hi> (that <hi>firſt</hi> he ſpoke of an Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and <hi>afterwards</hi> of a <hi>Legal</hi>) I reconcile him to his Elder Brother <hi>Calvin,</hi> and confirm my Argument from his ſaid 20th. <hi>Epiſtle;</hi> and ſo recover the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which I <hi>ſeemed to have loſt</hi> by miſtaking his ſenſe of the word <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is the only miſtake that (after many ſerious repeated thoughts) I can find that I committed in citing and explaining the words of Authours, and I did not do it (as many do) to make the Authour <hi>ſeem</hi> to ſpeak <hi>for me;</hi> but <hi>rather to make him ſeem</hi> to be in that <hi>againſt me.</hi> By which the World may ſee my Honeſty and Ingenuity in citing Authours.

Here it is plainly enough expreſſed, that the Goſpel requires Faith of us, as that by which we apprehend and lay hold on Chriſt: And elſewhere (as was ſhewed in the Apology) <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith expreſly, That Faith is <hi>the Condition,</hi> and I alſo have ſeveral times ſaid expreſly that in my Judgment, <hi>Faith is the only Condition, i. e.</hi> the only receptive applicative Condition of the Goſpel-Covenant, and of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs as held forth to us in the ſaid Covenant. (2.) Though in this ſhort Sum of the Goſpel, <hi>Beza</hi> do not expreſly mention Evangelical Repentance, yet he doth not exclude it, but <hi>rather includes and implyes it,</hi> in that he ſays that Chriſt is made <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> unto his People, which he is partly <hi>in requiring Repentance as a means neceſſary</hi> in order to pardon of Sin; and partly <hi>in giving them Grace, and inclining their hearts to repent. Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. and 11.18. And elſewhere as in his 20th Epiſtle <hi>Beza</hi> expreſly aſſerts and proves that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Repentance is required in the Goſpel, as <hi>antecedently</hi> in order of Nature neceſſary to pardon of Sin.</p>

For I <hi>never thought otherwiſe</hi> than that in the <hi>Law ſtrictly</hi> taken <hi>for the Covenant of Works</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> takes it) there is no
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93175:17"/>mention of Gods gracious Purpoſes to ſave us by Chriſt the Redeemer; and therefore that the Declaration of that Gracious Will of God, belongs to the Goſpel; and to <hi>Beza</hi>'s Words, I add that <hi>it belongs only to the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7.) <hi>H. Bullinger</hi> is next brought as a Witneſs againſt me. I Anſwer, That I admit what <hi>Bullinger</hi> ſaith, as cited by my Reverend Brother to be a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition <hi>or deſcription</hi> of the Goſpel, but I deny it to be an accurate <hi>perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,</hi> becauſe it doth not expreſs <hi>all the Eſſential parts</hi> of the Goſpel. For inſtance, it doth not expreſs the promiſe of taking away the Heart of Stone, and giving an Heart of Fleſh, and writing the Law in the Heart. <hi>etc.</hi> Which is an Eſſential of the Goſpel Covenant adequately conſidered, I grant <hi>Bullinger</hi> ſuppoſes and implyes it, but <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> and <hi>implying</hi> in a <hi>definition, all the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials</hi> of the thing defined, <hi>is not ſufficient</hi> to make it <hi>an accurate full definition.</hi> Otherwiſe, if a Man in defining a thing, expreſs <hi>but one of its Eſſentials,</hi> he might be ſaid to have accurately and fully defined it, becauſe the <hi>other Eſſentials</hi> are ſuppoſed and implyed <hi>in that one, they being all inſeparably connected in the thing defined.</hi> And yet all Men of any meaſure of Learning know that it is very <hi>abſurd</hi> to ſay, that a thing is <hi>accurately and perfectly defined,</hi> by mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>only one of its Eſſential Parts.</hi> I do not ſay this to reflect upon <hi>Bullinger</hi> at all, (that be far from me.) But to ſhew that by that which he called <hi>a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Goſpel, <hi>he did not mean an accurate perfect definition</hi> of it in reſpect of all its Eſſential parts, but <hi>a deſcription of it</hi> in reſpect of <hi>ſome of its Eſſential parts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſc. p</hi> 32.</note> in which the <hi>reſt are ſuppoſed and implyed.</hi> And even in this paſſage of his Sermon under conſideration, it is <hi>plainly implyed</hi> that the Goſpel-Covenant <hi>is conditional,</hi> and that <hi>Faith is the condition of it.</hi> And in another paſſage of the ſame Sermon, he ſays, That <hi>God hath propoſed Chriſt a Propitiation, to wit, that he might be our reconciliation, for whoſe ſake being pacified towards us, he adopts us to he the Children of God.</hi> (Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rùm non aliâ ratione quàm per ſidem in ejus Sanguinem, id eſt, Si credamus, &amp;c.) <hi>But no other way,</hi> or <hi>upon no other terms, than by Faith in his Blood, that is, if we believe,</hi> &amp;c. And in his Commentary on <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. he expreſly affirms the Covenant of Grace to be Conditional: As ſhall be ſhown by his own expreſs words, in my Remarks on the following Chapter. And I wiſh Mr. G— would ſeriouſly conſider what the ſame <hi>Bullinger</hi> writes at large in his Commentary on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. By what I have read of that Learned and Holy Mans Writings, I am ſure that his Judgment in this matter, and my Reverend Brothers do not agree, and that he wrongs him, in labouring to draw him to his Party.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) Next the Learned <hi>H. Zanchius</hi> is ſuborned to bear Witneſs againſt us. I confeſs that <hi>Zanchy</hi> well deſerves the high Commendation which Mr. G. gives him, but I am heartily ſorry that my R. B. ſhould ſo abuſe that Worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as to indeavour to make him contradict himſelf in Witneſs-bearing. For if ever our Reverend Brother read and conſidered our Apology, which he writes againſt, he cannot but know that we appealed to <hi>Zanchy</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 99. and from his own <hi>expreſs</hi> formal words, proved that <hi>there are</hi> [Tria Evangelii capita, quae a nobis exiguntur, ut praeſtemus, poenitentia in Deum, &amp;c.] <hi>Three Heads or Principal parts of the Goſpel, which we are required to do, Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, Faith in Jeſus Christ, and a Studious care to obſerve whatſoever Christ hath Commanded.</hi> Now theſe being <hi>Zanchy</hi>'s own expreſs words, it was very ill done by my Reverend Brother, to endeavour to make the World believe that this ſame <hi>Zanchy</hi> held, That the Goſpel requires nothing of us at all? And this he endeavours to do, by alledging Three Short Sentences out of his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93175:17"/>Miſcellanies, whereof the firſt Two <hi>only ſay, That the Goſpel is a Doctrine which Declares and Proclaims that Salvation is to be had freely in Christ by Faith, and by Faith only.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 32.</note> All which is very true, but nothing at all to the purpoſe. For the Goſpel doth that, and more too. It declares that Salvation is to be had freely in Chriſt <hi>by Faith alone;</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Faith alone which receives, apprehends, and applyes Christ and his Righteouſneſs for Justification and Salvation.</hi> This <hi>we hold,</hi> as <hi>Zanchy</hi> did; but withal, <hi>Zanchy</hi> held, and we after him do hold alſo, That <hi>the Goſpel requires of us Repentance towards God, Faith in Jeſus Christ,</hi> and <hi>a studious Care to obſerve whatſoever Christ hath commanded;</hi> To which add what <hi>Zanchy</hi> believed as well as we, That the <hi>Goſpel promiſeth Grace to enable us to believe, repent, and obey the Goſpel,</hi> and when through Grace we do ſo, <hi>it further promiſes us Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin and Eternal Life for Chriſt's ſake alone:</hi> And <hi>nothing more is neceſſary</hi> to make the Goſpel <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> according to our declared <hi>known ſenſe</hi> of that <hi>word.</hi> His Third Teſtimony out of <hi>Zanchy</hi> is yet more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, to wit,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 33.</note> That the <hi>Goſpel is the joyful Preaching of that Eternal and Free Love of God (this is Eternal Election) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in his Beloved Son Chriſt.</hi> For I would fain know what Mr. G— can juſtly infer from this Sentence of <hi>Zanchy</hi> to his purpoſe againſt us? This we grant to be true (as was ſaid in our firſt preliminary Conſideration) that the Revelation of Gods Eternal Decree, to ſave through Chriſt a Select Number of loſt Sinners of Mankind, <hi>is Goſpel;</hi> becauſe it is good and glad tydings to the Church. But what then? Dare Mr. G—infer that becauſe it is Goſpel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other thing is Goſpel? Then it ſeems by his Logick, one may prove that <hi>one part</hi> of a thing, <hi>is the whole</hi> thing; and that <hi>the whole</hi> thing, is but <hi>one part</hi> of it. But I forbear to expoſe ſuch weak arguing. If therefore the Joyful Preaching of God's Free Election through Chriſt be not the whole, but a part of the Goſpel, then though this part, do not require Faith and Repentance, yet another part of it may, and <hi>really doth</hi> require them in the Judgment of <hi>Zanchy;</hi> as was clearly proved in the Apology by his expreſs formal words, quoted out of his Book of Chriſtian Religion, 3d. <hi>Vol.</hi> of his Works, <hi>p.</hi> 509.</p>
               <p>And ſince it comes in my way to make mention of this Book of the Learned <hi>Zanchy,</hi> I will here give the World a further account of it, and of his Faith out of it. The Book is Entitled, Jerom Zanchy <hi>his Faith concerning the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi> It contains a full Confeſſion of his Faith which he wrote in the Seventieth year of his Age, and in his own Name, and in the Name of his Family, he Publiſhed it, and Dedicated it to Count <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes Martinengus</hi> It is an Excellent, Judicious Confeſſion of Faith.

I have diligently read it, and having quoted ſome paſſages out of it in the Apology, I will now quote ſome more out of it, both to make Mr. G. aſhamed (if poſſible) and ſo to bring him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He had ſaid that the Goſpel requires of us, not only Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, but likewiſe Repentance towards God, and an Endeavour to obſerve all that Chriſt hath Commanded.

                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> He appeals to Nine Reformed Divines, whom he refers to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quoting their words, and pretends that they all <hi>earnestly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the Goſpel in the peculiar Nature of it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 33.</note> is <hi>no other than a Syſteme of Promiſes. Anſw.</hi> (1.) What doth Mr. G— mean by <hi>the Goſpel in the peculiar Nature of it?</hi> If he mean <hi>nothing but a bundle of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſes,</hi> which <hi>require no Duty</hi> of us at all, I do freely grant, that the Goſpel taken in that reſtrained and limited Senſe, <hi>is no other</hi> than a <hi>Syſteme of Promiſes,</hi> and thoſe Promiſes abſolute too. And that this is Mr. G—'s meaning appears by his whole Book. But if he ſhall ſay that by <hi>the Goſpel in the peculiar Nature of it;</hi> he means <hi>the intire Covenant of Grace in its Evangelical Chriſtian Form of Adminiſtration,</hi> Then I deny that the Goſpel in that ſenſe is <hi>no other</hi> than a Syſteme <hi>of Promiſes ſo as to have no Precepts of its own at all. Anſw.</hi> 2. If any of the Nine Authours referred to, do any where ſay, That the Goſpel in its peculiar Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> taken for the intire Covenant of Grace, is no other than a Syſteme of Promiſes, It is like that by Syſteme of Promiſes, they mean a Syſteme of Promiſes which are partly Abſolute, and partly Conditional; and then in the Conditional Promiſes, they imply and include the Precepts and Threatnings. For (1.) The Conditional Promiſe of God to Man, implyes Gods Precept, obliging. Man to perform the Condition. (2.) The Word of God which promiſes to Man a benefit <hi>only,</hi> if he perform a certain Condition; doth neceſſarily imply the Threatning of not having the ſaid benefit, if he do not perform the Condition. And in this ſenſe it is poſſible that ſome of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines have ſometimes ſaid that the Goſpel is no other than a Syſteme of Promiſes, and yet they meant that the Conditional Promiſes do imply and include both Precepts and Threatnings. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Though I have not all thoſe Nine Authours by me at preſent, and ſo cannot now examine the ſeveral paſſages referred to, yet I am ſure Mr. G—doth wrong to ſeveral of them, in in giving out, that they are of his Opinion; for by what I remember to have read in them, and have quoted out of them in the Apology, and in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the 7th. Chapter, I know, as certainly, that what Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith of them is falſe <hi>in his ſenſe,</hi> as I know it to be true, that ever there were ſuch Men and ſuch Books in the World. And particularly I know what he ſays to be falſe with reſpect to <hi>Pareus, Rivet, Gerard, Walleus,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay it is falſe that they earneſtly maintained, That the <hi>Goſpel taken for the intire Covenant of Grace is a Syſtem of meer abſolute Promiſes, which hath neither Conditional Promiſe nor Precept.</hi>

                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> He brings Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> againſt <hi>Duraeus,</hi> to witneſs againſt us, That the Goſpel is nothing but a Declaration and Narrative of Grace, that requires nothing to be done by us. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> is there defending what <hi>Luther</hi> had written, And though it is well known and confeſt by <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves, that <hi>Luther</hi> was not alwayes ſo cautious and exact in expreſſing his ſenſe of things, as other Divines uſe to be; yet <hi>Whitaker</hi> thought, that what he had written, was capable of a good Sence, to wit, That ſince according to <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>word Goſpel</hi> ſignified nothing elſe, but the Preaching and Publiſhing of the Grace and Mercy of God, merited and purchaſed for us by Chriſt's Death; The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might be accounted the beſt Evangeliſt, and his Epiſtles with <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, might be preferred before the Goſels of <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke;</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> did moſt of all Preach and Publiſh the Grace and Mercy of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93175:19"/>God through Chriſt; both by Word and Writ. And therefore <hi>Whitaker</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the defence of <hi>Luther</hi> in this matter, Firſt againſt <hi>Campian,</hi> and afterwards againſt <hi>Duroeus,</hi> Now <hi>Luthers</hi> definition of the Goſpel, (on which he founded his Argument which the Jeſuits found fault with, affirming that he had caſt a Bone among the Four Evangeliſts, and had preferred <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles before the Three firſt Evangeliſts) ſeems plainly to be taken from the ſignification of the <hi>Original Word,</hi> For Goſpel, or, good Tydings; and ſo it is rather <hi>(definitio nominis quàm rei)</hi> a definition of the <hi>word [Goſpel],</hi> than of the <hi>intire thing</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed by the <hi>word.</hi> Or admitting it to be a definition of the thing, yet it is but an imperfect definition, commonly called a Deſcription, which doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily contain all the Eſſentials of the thing defined, or rather deſcribed. And this way of defining, that is, deſcribing things, being ordinarily allowed to Orators as ſuch; Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> being a great Orator, and uſing his Rhetorick very much, (as his Adverſaries alſo did) though in Controverſial Writings, he might well think it allowable to <hi>defend</hi> in <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>likewiſe</hi> in his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to <hi>uſe, ſuch a definition or deſcription</hi> of the Goſpel: And yet not intend to tell the World (as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would have it) That in his Judgment the Goſpel is a Declaration, of Grace and Mercy, <hi>in ſuch a ſence, as to exclude</hi> all Duty, and <hi>to require nothing of us at all;</hi> no, not ſo much <hi>as Faith in Chriſt.</hi> That this could not be either <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Whitakers</hi> meaning in ſo defining or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Goſpel, is hence evident, That they both maintain the Goſpel to be a Declaration of God's Mercy and Grace purchaſed by Chriſt, <hi>in that ſenſe,</hi> wherein <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles aſſerted it to be a Declaration of God's Mercy and Grace purchaſed by Chriſt; But as I ſhall clearly prove in my Remarks on the next Chapter, <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> never aſſerted the Goſpel to be a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Mercy and Grace purchaſed by Chriſt <hi>in ſuch a ſenſe</hi> as excludes all Duty, and requires nothing at all, no, not ſo much as Faith in Chriſt. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. It is moſt manifeſtly falſe, that Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> held the Goſpel to be ſuch a Narrative and Declaration of Grace, as requires no Duty at all, not ſo much as Faith in Chriſt. For in his Anſwer to <hi>Campians</hi> Reaſons Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>Richard Stock,</hi> and Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1606. In Pages 252, 253. he writes thus [<hi>Now you</hi> (Campian) <hi>add, The Decalogue belongeth not to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. God doth not care for our Works.

In the Law, the Old Covenant is contained, Do this and live; Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law to do them. The Law promiſeth Life to them which obey the Law in all things. They that offend in anything, to them it threatneth Death and Damnation; an hard Condition, and which no Man can ever ſatisfie: Chriſt doth propoſe to us another Condition, much eaſier; Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.

                        <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</note> By this New Covenant, the Old is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo as whoſoever believeth the Goſpel, is freed from the Condition of the Law. For they that believe, are not under the Law, but under Grace,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18.) <hi>What needs many words? Chriſtians are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Curſe of the Law, but not from the Obedience of it.</hi>] Thus <hi>Whitaker.</hi> Whereby it is plain that he believed a Conditional Goſpel, and that it <hi>requires</hi> of us the <hi>performance</hi> of its <hi>Conditoon,</hi> in order to our being freed from <hi>the Condition,</hi> and delivered from <hi>the Curſe</hi> of the Law. And here it may not be amiſs to let the World know, that under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whilſt Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> was <hi>Regius Profeſſor</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> there was one Dr. <hi>Peter Baro,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who was for ſome time <hi>Margarets</hi> Profeſſor; and having Preached, and afterwards Printed a <hi>Latine</hi> Sermon on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. And having therein affirmed (as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> doth) That Men are obliged to believe in Chriſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93175:19"/>by the Moral Law, and not by the Goſpel <hi>(as his Words were interpreted),</hi> he was thereupon, and on the account of ſome other prelections alſo, ſuppoſed to be an <hi>Innovator,</hi> and he fell under ſuſpicion of inclining to thoſe Doctrines <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards</hi> called <hi>Arminian,</hi> and for that reaſon under the diſpleaſure of Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> who was a ſtrict <hi>Calviniſt:</hi> Whereupon he reſigned his place, and removed to <hi>London.</hi> But they did not leave him ſo: For there was a Book written againſt his <hi>Latine</hi> Sermon aforeſaid, by <hi>E.

                  <hi>[O miſerable and blind conſequence! As if forſooth.

                  <hi>[The Goſpel may, not unfitly, be defined this way.

Brothers Buſineſs. For (1.) Gomarus <hi>here doth not pretend accurately</hi> and <hi>fully to define the</hi> Goſpel, and therefore he <hi>only</hi> ſays, <hi>[it may, not unfitly, be defined this way.]</hi> And one may well enough expreſs himſelf thus, when he is to give <hi>only a general Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which is an imperfect definition) of a thing. (2.) This Deſcription of the Goſpel goes before <hi>in the</hi> 25th, <hi>Poſition;</hi> Whereas the Teſtimony quoted out of him in the Apology, comes after in the 30th. <hi>Poſition,</hi> in which, Gomarus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly explains himſelf,</hi> and <hi>adds</hi> what he had before <hi>omitted</hi> in his deſcription of the Goſpel, <hi>Theſ.</hi> 25. and <hi>expreſly</hi> aſſerts the Goſpel to be <hi>a Law,</hi> and a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> and gives his Reaſons for both. (3.) Here then <hi>Gomarus</hi> did not in the leaſt contradict himſelf; only in <hi>Theſ.</hi> 30. he <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>expreſſed</hi> what he had <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> and <hi>implyed,</hi> and <hi>added</hi> what he had <hi>omitted</hi> in <hi>Theſ.</hi> 25. (4.) Here alſo Mr. G—ſhould have conſidered <hi>Gomarus,</hi> his 29. <hi>Poſition,</hi> which I quoted at large in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 100; but ſhall not here repeat it, for he cannot but have ſeen it, ſince it is immediately before the 30th, which he pretends to Anſwer. Theſe things being duely conſidered, it is as clear as the Light, that my R— Brother dealt very diſingenuouſly (not to uſe a worſe word) when he thus concluded <hi>pag.</hi> 34. of his Diſcourſe [<hi>Therefore when</hi> Gomarus <hi>a little after, calls the Goſpel</hi> a Law, <hi>he muſt neceſſarily underſtand, the word Goſpel, as it ſignifies all the ſecond part of the Bible, not as it implyes only God's Covenant of Grace diſcovered to Man</hi>] This is <hi>ſo far from being true de facto,</hi> that <hi>it is impoſſible it ſhould be true:</hi> And my R.B. who hath read the place, if he knows any thing, cannot but know that it is falſe. For it is moſt evident from <hi>Gomarus</hi> his words, both as they are in his own Works, and as they are cited in the Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 27. and 100. That the Goſpel he ſpeaks of, <hi>is not the Book of the</hi> New Teſtament, but <hi>it is the very Covenant of Grace</hi> it ſelf, both <hi>diſcovered</hi> unto, <hi>and made with</hi> Man, <hi>and recorded in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93175:20"/>Books, both of the</hi> Old <hi>and</hi> New Teſtament. It is the Covenant which hath <hi>a condition in it preſcribed</hi> to us, and <hi>required</hi> of us. Yea, It is, <hi>the Law of Faith</hi> Rom. 3.27. It is the <hi>Law which goes forth out of Sion,</hi> as he proves from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. And that Mr. G— himſelf hath acknowledged to be the very Goſpel in its ſtrict and proper Senſe. How to excuſe my R. B. here from being guilty of a known falſincation, I profeſs I know not. But whatever be of that, ſure I am that <hi>Gomarus</hi> his own words, cannot bear that ſence which he would force upon them: And I appeal to Schollars and Judicious honeſt Men, to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, and determine which of us two, gives the genuine true Senſe of thoſe words of <hi>Gomarus,</hi> which I quoted in the Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 27, and 100.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> Mr. G— to back the foreſaid Miſinterpretation of <hi>Gomarus</hi> his Words concerning the Nature of the Goſpel-Covenant, brings the Teſtimony of the Heavenly Hoſt of Holy Angels, recorded in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. but this doth not move me in the leaſt from my ſteadfaſt belief of the Goſpel Covenant, its being <hi>a Law of Grace.</hi> For from the Angels Doxology in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. neither Man nor Angel can ever prove by good conſequence, that the Covenant of the Goſpel, is <hi>not a Law of Grace.</hi> The Angels not ſaying expreſly that it is <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> proves nothing. For it was no part of their Commiſſion, to ſay <hi>that it is,</hi> or <hi>that it is not.</hi> What they ſaid, is true indeed, ay, and it is true Goſpel too; as was acknowledged before in our firſt preliminary conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But what then? It doth not follow that therefore it is <hi>the whole Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>intire Covenant of Grace,</hi> which God made with his Church, through Chriſt the Mediator. And if it be not the <hi>whole,</hi> as it is not, then <hi>what they ſaid,</hi> and <hi>what Gomarus</hi> and <hi>I after him ſay,</hi> that the Goſpel is <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> may <hi>both be true,</hi> and ſo <hi>they certainly are.</hi> But it ſeems Mr. G—thinks that God is not <hi>at peace with</hi> him (nor with me, nor with any other Man) nor <hi>bears any good Will</hi> to him, (or us), if by the Goſpel, he <hi>require</hi> Faith and Repentance of us in order to the Pardon of our Sins <hi>by and for</hi> the alone Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Mediator of the Covenant. And if that be really his ſettled Thought, his Caſe is to be pityed; and I heartily pray God for Chriſt's ſake, to pity him, and to deliver him from an evil heart of Unbelief: That he may through Grace come to the knowledge of the Truth, and be perſwaded that God's being at peace with him, and bearing good Will to him, is very well conſiſtent with the Goſpel-Covenant <hi>its requiring of him Faith and Repentance.</hi> As for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant upon the words of the Angels, it is nothing but a flouriſh of Words; and Rhetorick without Reaſon, makes no Impreſſion upon the Wiſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Effect it may have <hi>upon others.</hi> Now my R— Brother, his Premiſſes being falſe, as I have ſhewed them to be; his Concluſion <hi>as ſuch</hi> muſt be of the ſame Nature. And ſo it is not true, as he pretends, but really falſe, that God from Heaven, and ſome of the beſt Men whoever lived upon Earth, do plainly tell us, that the Goſpel <hi>is no Law,</hi> but <hi>a pure Act of Grace;</hi> for <hi>they do not tell us any ſuch thing.</hi> And to the Lords People, <hi>it is both.</hi> It is <hi>both a Law,</hi> and alſo, a pure Act of Grace; <hi>it is a Law of Grace.</hi> As for what he ſays, in <hi>page</hi> 35 of his Diſcourſe, that <hi>our Reformers were careful to diſtinguiſh the Goſpel from a Law;</hi> It is falſe <hi>in his Senſe;</hi> they were not careful to diſtinguiſh it <hi>from all kind of Law,</hi> but from <hi>a certain kind of Law,</hi> that is, from <hi>the Law of Works.</hi> This indeed they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do, and ſo are we too; And as they would not, ſo no more do we ſuffer Works under <hi>never ſo ſpecious pretences,</hi> to <hi>invade the Prerogative of Grace.</hi> In fine, what Mr. G—quotes <hi>there</hi> out of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>Beza, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93175:21"/>the Papiſts confounding Law and Goſpel, its being the occaſion of many pernicious Errors in the Church;</hi> is impertinently alledged againſt us; for we are ſo far from confounding the Law and the Goſpel, <hi>as</hi> Papiſts do, that on the contrary we believe the Goſpel <hi>to be a Law of Grace only;</hi> but not at all to be a <hi>Law of Works in the Scriptural,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh ſenſe</hi> of <hi>that word.</hi> And in our Apology, we <hi>plainly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the difference</hi> between the Law and Goſpel, and the Righteouſneſs of the one and the other; in ſo much, that whoever reads, underſtands, believes, and obſerves what we there wrote on that ſubject, is ſo far out of danger of the Popiſh Errors in the matter of Juſtification and Salvation, that <hi>it is plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi> for him to embrace any of them, <hi>without firſt renouncing</hi> ſome of thoſe great Truths, which we have plainly there laid down in vindicating our ſelves from the Calumnies of the <hi>Informer,</hi> and <hi>of the Accuſer of the Brethren.</hi> So much in Anſwer to his firſt ſet of Teſtimonies, relating to the definition or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Goſpel.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HIS next ſet of Teſtimonies of Reformed Divines, is to prove, (as he ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 36.) <hi>by their expreſs words, that when they call the Goſpel a Law, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no more by it, but a pure Doctrine of Grace.</hi> To which I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">(1. In general, That <hi>in a ſound ſenſe,</hi> I grant <hi>the Goſpel Law, is no other than a pure Doctrine of Grace,</hi> as was ſaid before. But <hi>in his ſenſe,</hi> I deny that they held <hi>the Goſpel-Law</hi> to be <hi>nothing but</hi> a pure Doctrine of Grace, <hi>ſo as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing of us,</hi> no, <hi>not ſo much as Faith</hi> in Chriſt. I ſhewed the contrary before from their own expreſs words in the 20th. <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Auguſtan Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> both ſubſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I give a particular Anſwer to the ſeveral Teſtimonies which Mr. G. alledges. And (1.) As for the Teſtimonies of <hi>Luther</hi> quoted out of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries on <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. His Firſt Teſtimony, as to the firſt part of it, concerns us not at all, for we abhor that Opinion of Juſtitiaries as much as ever <hi>Luther</hi> did; and we declare it to be Blaſphemy to think, ſay, or write that the Goſpel is <hi>no other than a Book</hi> which contains <hi>new Laws concerning Works, as the</hi> Turks <hi>Dream of their Alcoran.</hi> (2.) As to the Second part of his firſt Teſtimony, <hi>[That the Goſpel is a Preaching concerning Chriſt, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives Sins, gives Grace, Juſtifies and ſaves Sinners,]</hi> It is very true; but is not the <hi>whole Truth;</hi> for over and beſides that, it is alſo a Preaching concerning Chriſt, <hi>that requires Faith in Chriſt:</hi> According to the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion, and according to what we before heard from <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf in his little Book of Chriſtian Liberty, and which is <hi>far more,</hi> according to the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) As to the third part of his Teſtimony <hi>[That the Precepts found in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are not the Goſpel, but Expoſitions of the Law, and Appendixes of the Goſpel.]</hi> It is to be rightly underſtood. As (1) They are not the whole Goſpel.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93175:21"/>Nor (2.) Are they the principal part of the Goſpel, from which it chiefly hath its Denomination: For the Promiſes are that part. (3.) It is confeſt that there are indeed Precepts found written ſomewhere in the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are no part of the Goſpel Covenant in its laſt and beſt form of Adminiſtration; but they belong to the firſt Law of Works, or to the Typical Legal Form of Adminiſtring the Covenant of Grace; yet <hi>there are other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> for inſtance, that which Commands Faith in Chriſt as the Inſtrumental means of receiving and applying Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs for Juſtification; and this Precept even in <hi>Luthers</hi> Judgment (as we have proved) belongs to the Goſpel: And it is indeed one Article of the Goſpel-Covenant, that we believe in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>The Second Teſtimony from <hi>Luthers</hi> Commentary on <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alledged, and proves nothing but what we firmly believe, that <hi>the Goſpel is not a Law</hi> or <hi>Doctrine of Works for Juſtification,</hi> but <hi>a Law</hi> or <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> even <hi>a new Doctrine</hi> (as <hi>Luthers</hi> expreſſion is,) or <hi>Law of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) In the ſecond place, he brings a Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin</hi> out of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on <hi>Iſai</hi> 2.3. which as Mr. <hi>G</hi>— alledges it, is impertinent. For it proves nothing againſt us. We grant alſo to our R— Brother, that the way of arguing he mentions in <hi>Pag.</hi> 38. would be impertinent. And I aſſure him, it is not my way of arguing, to conclude from the Goſpels being <hi>named a Law,</hi> that it is a Doctrine of Works For I do not believe that it is a Doctrine (or Law) of Works at all, <hi>in the Scripture ſenſe of that word. i. e.</hi> a Doctrine of Works, <hi>by and for which Juſtification and Salvation are to be ſought after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Thirdly for the Teſtimony out of <hi>Muſculus</hi> on <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. I admit it as not being in the leaſt againſt me. And it is notorious that he was for the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality of the Covenant, as we are.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Nor Fourthly doth <hi>Gualters</hi> Teſtimony make againſt me in the leaſt, if it be not wreſted by a falſe gloſs put on his words, as if he had ſaid, That the Law of Faith, doth not require Faith: But he doth not ſay ſo in the words quoted by Mr. G—.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The Paſſage quoted out of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> on <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.3. makes <hi>rather for us, than againſt us,</hi> and therefore it was impertinently alledged. And it is well known that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> was <hi>not againſt,</hi> but <hi>for</hi> Conditions in the Goſpel-Covenant: And in my Remarks on the next Chapter, I ſhall prove by his own expreſs formal words that he believed as we do, that the Goſpel hath <hi>Precepts</hi> of its own which require of us Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Nor doth the Paſſage cited out of <hi>Chemnitius</hi> his Common Places contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict my Principles, but it rather confirms them. And I am well aſſured that he held Juſtifying Faith to be Commanded and required by the Goſpel. <hi>See his common places in Folio. pag.</hi> 219.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) And laſtly, For <hi>Wittichius</hi> his Teſtimony, the firſt part of it, <hi>doth not ſo much as ſeem</hi> to be againſt me, for it contains my Principle expreſt to my mind. I do heartily agree with him that no Works of ours, neither Repentance, nor yet Faith, are, <hi>or can be,</hi> the cauſe of our Juſtification, as perfect perſonal Works were to have been the cauſe and ground of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Juſtification by the firſt Covenant and Law of Works, if he had never broken it. But for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of his Teſtimony, if he intends thereby to deny that either Faith or Repentance are required as antecedently <hi>in order of Nature</hi> neceſſary unto Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93175:22"/>by and for the alone-Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: Then I do reject that part of his Teſtimony as unſound and contrary to Holy Scripture, and to the Judgment of our more Orthodox Divines. But I ſuppoſe <hi>Wittichius</hi> means on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſaving Faith and Repentance are not required as <hi>antecedently neceſſary in order of time,</hi> but that we are juſtifyed aſſoon as we believe and repent: And ſo I agree with him Or it may be, he meant that Faith is not <hi>(neceſſarium juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis praerequiſitum, ut ſimpliciter opus)</hi> a neceſſary praerequiſite unto Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>conſidered ſimply as a work</hi> And ſo I likewiſe agree with him. For though Faith <hi>be really an inward Heart work.</hi> and though it be <hi>pre required as neceſſary unto</hi> Juſtification; yet it is neither praerequired nor required unto Juſtification, ſimply and preciſely <hi>as a work</hi> and under that <hi>formal conſideration:</hi> But only as the receptive applicative Condition, or as the Inſtrumental means appointed by God for receiving, applying, and truſting Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs alone unto Juſtification. Thus I have examined and anſwered Mr. G—<hi>'s</hi> ſecond ſet of Teſtimonies, and ſhewed that <hi>not one of</hi> them rightly underſtood, makes againſt me.</p>
               <p>What he writes in the cloſe of this Sixth Chapter, hath in effect, and upon the matter,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſo.</hi> p. 41.</note> been anſwered before. And (1.) It is not true that we confound the Notions of things which are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct in their Natures and Idea's. For if one take the Goſpel <hi>in his ſenſe</hi> for a bundle of <hi>meer abſolute promiſes</hi> of what God in Chriſt will do, <hi>without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring any thing at</hi> all to be done by us; we freely grant that it is <hi>no Law</hi> at all to us in any proper ſenſe. But now the World knows very well, or may know by our Apology, that <hi>that is not the thing,</hi> which we mean by the Goſpel, when we affirm it to be <hi>a Law of Grace.</hi> But <hi>in truth,</hi> the thing which we have declared we mean by the Goſpel, when we affirm it to be <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> is <hi>no other but the Covenant of Grace made with us through Chriſt;</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends not only Abſolute, but Conditional Promiſes alſo, and which preſcribes to us the performance of the Condition, and tells us, we muſt through Grace perform it, or we ſhall not have the benefits promiſed. In this true, proper, comprehenſive ſenſe, the Goſpel is indeed <hi>a Law</hi> to us, <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> but <hi>not a Law of Works.</hi> For, as hath been ſaid, though it require Duties of us, which are indeed Works, yet the Goſpel Covenant doth not require them of us, <hi>under that formal Notion,</hi> as Works to be juſtifyed and glorifyed <hi>by and for them.</hi> But (1.) It requires Evangelical Repentance, (not as a Work to be Juſtified by and for, either in whole, or in part, but) <hi>as a Condition in the Subject or Perſon to</hi> be Juſtifyed, neceſſary to diſpoſe and qualifie him for Juſtification by and for Chriſt's Righteouſneſs only. (2.) It requires true Faith in Chriſt, <hi>not as a work to be juſtified for it</hi> in whole or in part; but as the <hi>only condition or inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal means whereby we apprehend, receive, apply, and truſt to Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſneſs, as the only Righteouſneſs whereby, and for which alone we are juſtifyed at the Bar of Gods Juſtice.</hi> (3) It requires Obedience (flowing from Faith,) Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I ſay to the whole revealed Will of God, <hi>not ſimply as Obedience, or Works for which we are glorifyed, but as Evangelically ſincere,</hi> and growing up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as a teſtimony of our thankfulneſs for our Redemption and Juſtification, as a means of glorifying God, of Crediting our Holy Religion, of Edifying our Neighbour, and of evidencing the ſincerity of our Faith, and finally, <hi>as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition neceſſary by the Constitution</hi> of God, to prepare and qualifie us for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory for the alone meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt our Lord and Saviour. So that the Goſpel thus requiring theſe things, <hi>is not a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93175:22"/>Law of Works, but of Grace;</hi> eſpecially conſidering that it is by Grace that we do theſe things required, and that the Grace whereby we do them, is promiſed in the Goſpel; and by the Spirit given according to the promiſe: And that when through Grace we have done them, then God of his rich Mercy and Free Grace gives us for Chriſts ſake the bleſſings and benefits promiſed to thoſe who do the Duties required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to what my Reverend Brother ſaith, That the Goſpel hath no minatory ſanction, that no Threatning doth properly belong to it. I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if one take the Goſpel, as he doth, for a bundle of meer abſolute Promiſes, then it is very true, that in that ſenſe it hath no minatory ſanction, no threatning doth properly belong to it; and for my part I declare that I never ſaid, nor thought (nor could deliberately think) that a Threatning was any part of it, either <hi>properly or improperly,</hi> as <hi>taken in that too narrow limited ſenſe,</hi> for meer abſolute Promiſes of what God in Chriſt will do for us, without requiring any thing to be done by us. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take the Goſpel in that ſenſe, in which I take it for the intire Goſpel-Covenant which God hath not only declared to, but <hi>made</hi> with his Church through the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, then my Anſwer is, That though the Goſpel taken oven in this comprehenſive ſenſe, for the whole of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace made with us through Chriſt, ſhould have no Threatning <hi>properly belonging to it,</hi> yet <hi>that would not hinder it</hi> from being a Law of Grace. For it is <hi>properly enough a Law of Grace to us.</hi> (1.) As it preſcribes to us its condition to be performed by us. (2.) As it promiſes Grace to enable us to perform its condition. (3.) As it promiſes to us great and gratuitous benefits upon our performing its condition through Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I anſwer, That over and beſides the Threatning of the firſt Covenant and Law of Works, (which Mr. G. fancies that the Goſpel promiſe doth bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and employ in its own ſervice), the Goſpel-Covenant hath (as plainly appears to me) its own additional Threatning; which I think is thus to be underſtood, that though a Threatning doth not belong to the Goſpel-Covenant as a Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>principally;</hi> yet it belongs to it <hi>ſecondarily</hi> and <hi>leſs principally,</hi> to wit, as it is a Covenant made with Sinners to reſtrain them from Sin, and to bring them unto Faith and Repentance. The <hi>primary deſign</hi> of the Goſpel-Covenant is indeed <hi>to promiſe</hi> gratuitous benefits to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>complying with its terms required;</hi> and it is but <hi>its ſecondary deſign</hi> to threaten puniſhment in caſe of non-complyance: And then further, even this threatning of puniſhment in reſpect <hi>of its primary deſign,</hi> is not to bring the puniſhment on the Sinner, but it is to reſtrain from Sin, and ſo preſerve from Puniſhment: And that the Puniſhment threatned <hi>is actually inflicted</hi> upon any who are called and commanded to comply with the terms of the Covenant, but do not; it comes to paſs <hi>through their unbelief and impenitence, as it were by accident in reſpect of the primary deſign</hi> of the Evangelical-Covenant as ſuch. And that this is true, to wit, That the Goſpel-Covenant hath its <hi>own</hi> additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Threatning, in the ſenſe aforeſaid, ſeems very evident to me. (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conditional promiſe of the Goſpel being made to the Believer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, to him and to no other, (<hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17.)
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 8.24.</note> it cannot but virtually imply that the Unbeliever ſhall not have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit promiſed, and that is a Threatning. (2.) Becauſe the Scripture is <hi>expreſs</hi> in the caſe, for <hi>over and beſides</hi> the Threatning for formerly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93175:23"/>breaking the Law; the Goſpel <hi>threatens for not ſincerely repenting and believing the Goſpel.</hi> John 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already. And why ſo?</hi> Why certainly, not <hi>only,</hi> becauſe he hath not perfectly kept the Law of Works, but <hi>likewiſe,</hi> as it follows immediately, <hi>becauſe</hi> he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God. And then in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. our Saviour ſaith this <hi>is the Condemnation,</hi> that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their deeds were evil. See alſo for this, the Commiſſion it ſelf which our Bleſſed Lord gave to his Apoſtles, and in them to all his Goſpel-Miniſters who ſucceed them in preaching the Goſpel. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He that believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> From which words it appears,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That it is the primary deſign of the Goſpel, that Men to whom it is Preached ſhould believe, and be Baptized, and that if they do ſo, they ſhould be ſaved; according to the true import of the Conditional Promiſe. But (2.) If they neglect or refuſe to believe, and by believing to uſe the Saving Remedy offered them in the Goſpel, againſt the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law, they ſhall be damned. And this is the ſecondary deſign of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to threaten Men with Condemnation if they believe not, that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may be a means to deter them from the Sin of Unbelief, and to preſerve them from being damned. According to this Goſpel, Men <hi>to whom it hath been Preached,</hi> will be judged at the laſt day. As it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel. Now in judging Men who have lived under the Preaching of the Goſpel, the Lord will juſtifie the true Penitent Believer, and condemn the Unbeliever, and that according to the Goſpel; whence it follows by good conſequence that the Goſpel hath Threatnings, as well as Promiſes, and that as the Believer ſhall then be juſtified according to the Promiſes, ſo the Unbeliever ſhall be Condemned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Threatnings of the Goſpel. But if the Goſpel have neither Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nor Threatning, nor Conditional Promiſe, (as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> affirms that it hath not.) I do not ſee how any Unbeliever could be judged and condemned according to the Goſpel. It cannot with any colour of reaſon be ſaid that he may be judged according to the abſolute Promiſe of the Goſpel. For the Abſolute Promiſe of the Goſpel was never made to ſuch an Unbeliever as lives and dyes in Unbelief. My R. B. will not admit that ever there was any Conditional Promiſe of the Goſpel, made to ſuch an Unbeliever; and if not a Conditional Promiſe, much leſs was there ever an Abſolute Goſpel-Promiſe made to him. If it be objected, That though the Believer cannot be both Judged and Juſtifyed by the Law, yet the Unbeliever may be both Judged and Condemned by the Law. I anſwer, It is true, Every Unbeliever is Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Condemned by the Law that he was under, and Tranſgreſſed; But beſides that, it is true, That <hi>ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers are likewiſe Judged and Condemned by the Goſpel, and according to the Goſpel.</hi> And therefore we ſaid in the Apology, <hi>pag</hi> 200. That profeſſed Chriſtians who live and dye in Impenitence and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, will be <hi>doubly</hi> condemned both by Law, and Goſpel. By the Law, for breaking it. And by the Goſpel for not believing in Chriſt, and not uſing and applying by Faith, the Remedy offered them in the Goſpel, againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Law. The ſame ſaith the Reverend, Learned and Judicious <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> on <hi>John;</hi> on the 18th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the Third of <hi>John,</hi> theſe are his words,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93175:23"/>
                  <q>[Chriſt goeth on to Clear and Illuſtrate the Certainty of the Salvation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him, by ſhewing on the contrary the Condemnation of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whom he declareth to be under a <hi>double</hi> Condemnation, one by the Law, and another by the Goſpel] And a little after [albeit the Sentence of the Law be ſufficient to Condemn Mankind, and will Condemn all them who have not heard of Chriſt; yet <hi>under the Goſpel,</hi> Unbelief, and not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt, is the great Condemning Sin; for as no Sin will condemn the Man, who fleeth to Chriſt the Remedy, ſo when the Remedy is not Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the Sentence of the Law is Ratified in the Goſpel and Court of Mercy: <hi>For he that believeth not, is condemned already becauſe he hath not believed.</hi> The Sentence is declared Juſt. and confirmed by a <hi>new Sentence,</hi> ſince he will not take help. And thus Unbelief is the great unpardonable Sin, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. Whereas other Sins (that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, excepted, becauſe it is joyned with final Impenitence) would be pardoned, if Men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>And on <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. <q>[Where Chriſt offering himſelf in the Goſpel, is not received in Love, but contemned, it bringeth <hi>ſadder Condemnation</hi> than the breaking of the Law, as being a ſinning <hi>againſt the Remedy,</hi> and that with an high hand; an undervaluing of him, and doing of what they can, to make void his pains. For this is the Condemnation, that Light hath come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. agrees with us, That Unbelievers ſhall be Judged and condemned by the Goſpel And it is ſomething ſtrange that a Miniſter of the Goſpel ſhould be at this day ſo far under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Unbelief, as to doubt of, or deny this, ſince Chriſt himſelf ſaith expreſly <hi>John</hi> 12.48. That the word which he hath ſpoken, ſhall judge the Unbeliever in the laſt day. And from the Context, it appears, that the ſaid <hi>Word</hi> which ſhall judge the Unbeliever, is the Word of the Goſpel. For it is the Word which Chriſt Preached, and which the Unbeliever received not: And I think that is the Word of the Goſpel. Nor am I ſingular in ſo thinking: For <hi>Calvin</hi> was of the ſame mind, as is evident from what he writes in his Commentary on <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>Non potuit magis ſplendido elogio extolli Evangelii authoritas, quàm dum illi judicii poteſtas defertur; conſcendet quidem ipſe Chriſtus Tribunal, ſed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam ex verbo quod nunc praedicatur, laturum ſe aſſerit.</hi> That is, The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Goſpel could not be more highly praiſed, nor a more glorious Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy given unto it, than in aſcribing to it the Power of judging Men. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall indeed aſcend the Judgment Seat, but he affirms that he will paſs the Sentence according to the Word which is now Preached. The Divines of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Aſſembly follow <hi>Calvin,</hi> for thus they write in their <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <q>The word that I have ſpoken.] The Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> which the Wicked now ſo ſecurely Contemn, ſhall once riſe in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, and Condemn them. (See <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>John</hi> 3.18) by ſo much the more heavily, by how much greater means of Salvation they have neglected.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> follows the Aſſembly Men, for thus he writes on <hi>John</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>Doctr.</hi> 7. <q>[Albeit in the day of Judgment, Wicked Men will be called to account for all their Sins againſt the Law, yet their Contempt of the Goſpel, will be their ſaddeſt ditty. <hi>For he that rejecteth me, the word that I have ſpoken, ſhall judge him.</hi> That is, <hi>The word of the Goſpel</hi>]</q> Many other places of Holy Scripture evince this Truth, that even the Goſpel hath its Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

And if the Goſpel require and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Faith in Chriſt, then the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> (which by Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> own confeſſion, ſignifies the <hi>Doctrine of the</hi> Goſpel), is a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> that requires and commands Duty, to wit, the Duty of Faith; and not ſuch a Doctrine of Grace as requires nothing at all. That it is a <hi>Doctrine of Grace,</hi> I never denyed in all my Life; but this conſequence I do utterly deny, that becauſe the Law of Faith is a Doctrine of Grace, therefore it doth not require nor command Faith in Chriſt, in order to Juſtification. And I am not alone in this. There are many others of good eſteem in the Church for Orthodoxy, who grant with me, That <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> ſignifies <hi>a Doctrine,</hi> and yet maintain as I do, that that ſame Doctrine preſcribes and commands Faith in order to Juſtification. At preſent I give three inſtances of this. As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) The <hi>Dutch Annotations</hi> on <hi>Rom</hi> 3.27. <hi>By the Law of Faith;</hi> [<hi>that is the preſcript, or the doctrine of Faith,</hi> &amp;c].

               <p>Now both his Propoſitions being falſe, no wonder that the inference he draws from them be ridiculous, inſignificant, and of no force at all againſt me; for I do freely grant that it is a fallacious way of reaſoning to argue from the meer ambiguity of a word that hath ſeveral ſignifications But that was not, nor is it my way of arguing. And this being the caſe, as I have truly repreſented it, and as manifeſtly appears from the Apology it ſelf; the ridiculous demonſtration, (to wit, <hi>a Law is a Law, the Goſpel is a Law,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel is a Law).

I am ſo well aſſured that <hi>there is no ſuch thing there,</hi> that I <hi>defy him,</hi> or any Man, to prove the affirmative <hi>that there it is.</hi> And by and by we ſhall <hi>find himſelf clearing me</hi> of that imputation, and <hi>blaming me</hi> for proving the Goſpel to be a Law, becauſe it hath <hi>Precepts requiring Duty, fortified with a ſanction of Promiſes and Threatnings:</hi> Which is a demonſtration that either this Brother aſſerts that which he knows to be falſe, or elſe that he contradicts himſelf, and writes he knows not what.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition then, or Major, is the birth of his own Brain, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was begotten againſt his Conſcience, as Baſtards uſe to be, let him look to it; I aſſert nothing <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> in that matter.</p>
               <p>As for the Aſſumption or ſecond Propoſition, he will not, he cannot deny it to be his own, (to wit. <hi>That the Goſpel is a Law, a meer nominal Law, which requires no Duty of us at all),</hi> for it is the great thing he contends for with all his Might throughout his Book. Now it appearing thus, that the Argument is his own, much good may it do him <hi>and his Cauſe,</hi> which the World may know to be a very good one, <hi>by this token,</hi> that it is ſupported by ſuch pretty honeſt Devices.</p>
               <p>And thus the pretty unanſwerable Argument is eaſily anſwered, when ſtript of its Identical dreſs. For both Propoſitions are falſe. The Major Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſelf evidently falſe, when ſtript of its Identical dreſs: And if he will not ſuffer <hi>his</hi> Baby to be ſtript of its Fools coat, my Anſwer is, That it is <hi>his own,</hi> and <hi>he may do with his own what he pleaſes.</hi> The Minor I have proved to be falſe, and ſhall further prove it to be falſe, before we have done. And therefore though the concluſion as to the <hi>matter</hi> concluded be very true, (according to the Logick Rule, <hi>ex falſis verum),</hi> yet it is not <hi>therefore formally</hi> true, <hi>as</hi> it is concluded, and <hi>becauſe</hi> it is concluded and inferred from ſuch
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93175:25"/>falſe premiſſes. But he pretends in <hi>pag.</hi> 42. to have provided a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt this malady of arguing from the ambiguity of a word of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſignification, by <hi>clearing</hi> the ſenſe of the word <hi>Law,</hi> which he ſays, he has largely done. But <hi>cui bono,</hi> to what good purpoſe was all that waſte of Time, Paper and Ink? ſince it doth not reach me at all; for I defy him to ſhew me, where, in the Apology, I did ever ſo much as once endeavour to prove the Goſpel to be a proper <hi>Law,</hi> from the <hi>meer ſound</hi> of the word <hi>Law,</hi> which is of a various ſignification. But though I did not ſo argue, yet my R. B. hath aſſumed to himſelf the liberty of arguing from the ambiguity of the word <hi>Goſpel, almoſt</hi> throughout his whole Diſcourſe, to prove that the Goſpel is <hi>ſo a Doctrine of Grace,</hi> as to require no Duty of us at all. <hi>Turpe est igitur doctori, quum culpa redarguit ipſum.</hi> I think it had been more to the purpoſe, to have cleared the ſenſe of the ambiguous word <hi>Goſpel, ſo</hi> as to have ſhewed that in Holy Scripture, or the Writings of Antient and Modern Divines, it is <hi>never</hi> taken for the Covenant of Grace made <hi>with the Church</hi> through Chriſt the Mediator, <hi>including the conditional part of it,</hi> but <hi>always</hi> and <hi>every where</hi> for a <hi>meer abſolute Promiſe</hi> or Promiſes, which <hi>require no Duty of</hi> us at all. If my Reverend Brother had done this, he had done his work, and had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me effectually, and had made me his Proſelite too. But I do not blame him for not doing this, becauſe it is plainly impoſſible to be done.</p>
               <p>But what if my purpoſe and deſign in the <hi>First Section</hi> of the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Apology</hi> (which he pretends to anſwer) was not ſo much to argue and prove the Goſpel to be a Law: As,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To <hi>inſtruct</hi> our Accuſer who ſeemed not to know our Principles, and to let him know what we really mean by a <hi>new Law of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) To <hi>rebuke</hi> him for ſaying <hi>ignorantly,</hi> that <hi>new Law of Grace</hi> was a <hi>new word</hi> of an old but ill meaning, and to prove by Teſtimonies of credible Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes Antient and Modern, that <hi>new Law of Grace</hi> was <hi>no new word</hi> of an old, but ill meaning; but that <hi>he</hi> in ſaying ſo, againſt us the Subſcribers, was a <hi>falſe Witneſs</hi> againſt his Brethren? And to ſhow that this was my purpoſe and deſign, there needs no more but to read the <hi>Apology, Page</hi> 20, 21, 22, 24.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Further: What if for the Inſtruction and Information of our Accuſer, I told him and the World plainly, (1.) That God moſt freely made the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and enacted the Law of Grace with us through Jeſus Chriſt. (2.) That God by this Law of Grace both obliges and encourages us to certain Duties; and alſo by the Promiſes of it obliges himſelf to juſtifie and glorifie us for Chriſts ſake, if we perform the Duties preſcribed, and comply with the terms injoyned. (3.) What if I plainly declared, that by <hi>new Law of Grace,</hi> I meant nothing but the new Covenant of Grace; and <hi>only</hi> ſaid, that this Goſpel-Covenant might be <hi>called</hi> a <hi>Law, without just cauſe of offence to the Brethren,</hi> becauſe the Scriptures of Truth <hi>call</hi> it a <hi>Law.</hi> Now if I did all this in the <hi>Apology, Page</hi> 21, 22, 23, 27. as I certainly did, and God, Angels and Men know it to be true; then my Reverend Brother did not do well to go about to deceive the People, and make them believe, that I introduce a new <hi>Law of Works to be juſtified and ſaved by and for them;</hi> and that my Arguments to prove it are all grounded upon the ambiguity of the word <hi>Law</hi> unexplained: All which is utterly falſe. I confeſs indeed what is true, that though my purpoſe and deſign was not to prove, but to explain and declare what we meant, yet <hi>en paſſant,</hi> on the by, and to ſhew that our explication was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93175:26"/>to Scripture, I dropped four paſſages of Scripture, and referred to more in the Margent, which do abundantly prove the thing they were quoted for. But it is as clear as the Light at Noon-day, that my Proof from the ſaid four paſſages of Scripture in the Line, and from the other referred to on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, is not in the leaſt eſtabliſhed upon the <hi>meer ambiguity</hi> of the word <hi>Law,</hi> but upon the plain ſenſe and meaning of the Scriptures there alledged: Nor <hi>could</hi> an Argument from thoſe Scriptures there quoted or referred to, be grounded upon the meer ambiguity of the word <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe the word <hi>Law</hi> is not to be ſound in any of them. Let any Man read them all over, and he ſhall find what I ſay to be true; to wit, that the word <hi>Law</hi> is not in any of them.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge likewiſe that a few Lines after, in the ſame 22th <hi>Page,</hi> I quote three Scriptures where the word <hi>Law</hi> is; but then it is again as clear as the Light, that I quoted thoſe three Scriptures to prove nothing but this, That our Brethren ſhould not diſlike our <hi>calling</hi> the Goſpel-Covenant a <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe the Scriptures of Truth <hi>call it ſo expreſly.</hi> And my R. Brother ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges now with me, that it is ſo called in two of the places, to wit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. and in ſeveral others which he hath quoted.</p>
               <p>As for my other Argument from Humane Authority, neither is that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on the ambiguity of the word <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>on the word it ſelf, its being found</hi> in the Writings of Antient and Modern Divines long before we were born. From whence I clearly proved that the <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>not new,</hi> but old. And if the Teſtimonies of my Witneſſes <hi>prove more,</hi> (as they really do) even that the Goſpel-Covenant was <hi>not onely of old called a Law,</hi> but that it <hi>really is a Law of Grace,</hi> which requires ſome Duty of us, that was <hi>beſide</hi> my deſign and purpoſe, which was <hi>only</hi> to prove <hi>matter of fact;</hi> as appears from the expreſs words of the <hi>Apology, pag.</hi> 24. <hi>lin.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>If any object that in the <hi>Preface,</hi> and <hi>Index</hi> of the <hi>First Section</hi> of the <hi>Second Chapter,</hi> it is ſaid expreſly that <hi>we have proved the Goſpel to be a new law of Grace, by the Word of God, or Scripture, and by the Teſtimonies of Antient Fathers and Modern Divines.</hi> I Anſwer, It is true, it is ſaid ſo. But then conſider, that the ſaid <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Index</hi> were Written and Printed after the <hi>Apology</hi> was Finiſhed, and Printed; though in the Book they are both put before it; as it is the cuſtom to write <hi>Prefaces</hi> and <hi>Indexes</hi> laſt, and yet place them firſt in Books. Now when I wrote the <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Index,</hi> taking a review of all that was ſaid on that head in the <hi>Apology,</hi> I found that my Quotations from Scripture and Doctors had proved more than I deſigned. (1.) I deſigned <hi>only</hi> to explain our meaning; and by citing the four Scriptures in the Line, and others in the Margent, to ſhow that our explication was agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. (2.) By alledging the Teſtimonies of Antient and Modern Doctors of the Church, I deſigned <hi>only to prove matter of fact;</hi> to wit, that <hi>new law of Grace</hi> was no <hi>new word,</hi> but old. This was what I deſigned in writing that part of the <hi>Apology.</hi> But by looking it over after it was Printed, I found that the Scriptures cited and referred to, and the Teſtimonies of Doctors there alledged, do really prove that the Goſpel-Covenant made with the Church, through Chriſt the Mediatour, is a new Law of Grace which requires ſome Duties of us, and which promiſes to juſtifie and glorifie us for Chriſts ſake only, if we through Grace perform the ſaid Duties. And for this reaſon it was that in the <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Index,</hi> I ſaid, that we had proved the Goſpel in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93175:26"/>ſenſe there given, to be <hi>a new Law of Grace,</hi> both by Scripture, and by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Ancient Fathers and Modern Divines.</p>
               <p>If any do further object, That Humane Teſtimony can only prove matter of fact, I anſwer, It's true Humane Teſtimony ſimply <hi>as ſuch,</hi> can ſolidly prove no more, nor did I bring Humane Teſtimonies to prove any thing, but that the Goſpel Covenant was in their time <hi>called</hi> a New Law, and a New Law of Grace, and that they believed it to be ſuch a Law; which is nothing but <hi>matter of Fact.</hi> Yet Men by giving Teſtimony to Matter of Fact, may at the ſame time, and in the ſame Teſtimony bring ſuch Arguments from Scripture or Reaſon, as ſhall likewiſe prove <hi>matter of right</hi> And this my Witneſſes did, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Cyprian, Auſtin,</hi> the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden, Gomtrus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi>) they both called the Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>a Law, a New Law;</hi> a New Law of Grace, which proves the matter of fact; and moreover in their Teſtimonies to the matter of Fact, they alledged ſuch places of Scripture, or gave ſuch reaſons as do prove the matter of Right, to wit, That the <hi>Goſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l Covenant is a New Law of Grace,</hi> and may and ought to be ſo accounted.</p>
               <p>Now having firſt told the World how eaſily he could anſwer my Arguments, and wipe off all my Citations, upon a ſuppoſition which is of his own feigning, and notoriouſly <hi>falſe,</hi> as I have proved; he next comes to anſwer my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is indeed my <hi>one</hi> Argument from Scripture; for in effect there is no more but <hi>one,</hi> and that <hi>one</hi> is there brought to confirm our Explication of the words, <hi>Goſpel Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> and to ſhew that what we mean by thoſe words, is conſonant to the Scriptures of Truth; as is evident from the 21. and 22. <hi>pag.</hi> of the Apology. Well, But be it Argument or Arguments, he undertakes to give us a clear Anſwer to it; and in order thereunto he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to do three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To ſhew that the Goſpel hath no Precepts or Commandments. (2.) That it hath no Threatnings. (3.) That it hath no Conditional Promiſes. This is directly againſt the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> who, in their <hi>Synopſis of purer Divinity,</hi> ſay expreſly (as their words are quoted in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 27.) that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is ſometimes called <hi>a Law,</hi> becauſe it <hi>alſo</hi> hath its <hi>own</hi> Commandments, and its <hi>own</hi> Promiſes and Threatnings.</p>
               <p>It is alſo againſt <hi>Gomarus,</hi> who, as he is quoted in the ſame <hi>page</hi> 27, ſaith expreſly, That the Goſpel is called the Law of Faith, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.) and the Law of God by way of Excellency, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3.) from the preſcription or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Condition, and Duty contained in it. But let it be againſt them, or againſt all Mortals, yet if he did well and ſolidly prove theſe three things mentioned, I ſhould confeſs he doth his work effectually; were it not for this <hi>one thing,</hi> (on which the ſtreſs of his Cauſe lyes, and) which he begs, but proves not, nor can prove; to wit, That <hi>the Goſpel Covenant made with the Church through Chriſt the Mediator, and that adequately or intirely conſidered in all its Articles, is nothing but an Abſolute Promiſe, or a Bundle of Abſolute Promiſes which require nothing of us at all.</hi> For take the <hi>Goſpel in this narrow Senſe,</hi> and I declare that I believe as firmly as he can do, that it hath neither Precept, nor Threatning, nor Conditional Promiſe properly and eſſentially belonging to it. But now I muſt again tell my Reverend Brother, as I told him before, That that is not the ſenſe wherein I take it, when I ſay it is a Law of Grace, and I have ſhewed in the Apology, that it ought not to be ſo taken, nor is it ſo taken by our Proteſtant Divines, when the word <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is uſed to ſignifie the whole Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93175:27"/>of Grace, which God hath made with us through Chriſt the Mediator. Thus in few words it may appear, that the main ſtrength of his Cauſe lyes in the ambiguity of the word <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which certainly ſignifies more things than one, and particularly, it ſignifies more things than ſuch a Doctrine of Grace, as (according to his fancy) requires nothing of us at all. And,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Firſt, He aſſerts <hi>page</hi> 42. That the Precepts which the Goſpel employs, are not any parts of it ſelf, but are <hi>borrowed</hi> from the Law, and then gives his goodly reaſons for his aſſertion. Before I give particular Anſwers to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I will in the following Section premiſe ſome things that may give ſome light to help People to ſee on whoſe ſide the Truth lyes.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>SECT II.</head>
               <p>AND with reſpect to his Notion of the Goſpel, Let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) How the Goſpel (if it be nothing but an Abſolute Promiſe that requires nothing) can <hi>borrow</hi> Precepts from the Moral Law, and then employ them in its own Service. For mine own part I profeſs I neither do nor can underſtand how an Abſolute Promiſe <hi>borrows</hi> a Precept, and then employs it: As he gives us to underſtand towards the end of the 42. <hi>page.</hi> I underſtand well enough that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> there inſinuates, and <hi>pag.</hi> 48. he expreſly aſſerts this of the Goſpels borrowing and employing the Laws Precepts. And if any other Body can underſtand <hi>how</hi> a meer Abſolute Promiſe <hi>doth this,</hi> much good may the Notion do them: But to me, it is altogether uſeleſs, becauſe it is unintelligible.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Conſider, That the Moral Natural Law is certainly moſt perfect in its kind, and obliges to the moſt perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſinleſly perfect performance of the ſeveral Duties that belong to it, in that way which the Lord God intended it ſhould oblige to the performance of them. And it was needleſs to prove this againſt me, for I never denyed it, but alwayes believed it, and oft times openly profeſſed it; And if my Reverend Brother underſtands what and whom he writes againſt, he cannot but know that my R— Brethren and I made Publick Profeſſion of this to the World in the Printed Apology, <hi>page</hi> 200, and 201.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Conſider Thirdly, That we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Moral Natural Law, its Obligative Power, and its Actual Obligation. And it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that it hath its Obligative Power, even then when for want of a particular Object, or neceſſary Circumſtances, it doth not put forth its Power into Act, and lay its Actual Obligation on a certain Subject. For inſtance, In the ſtate of Innocency, The Law had in it an Obligative Power unto ſeveral things, which yet in that State it neither did nor <hi>could actually</hi> oblige our firſt Parents unto, for want of a proper Object; as to relieve the Poor when as yet there were none, and to Educate their Children Religiouſly, when as yet they had none.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Conſider Fourthly, That the Moral Law either obliges abſolutely and for the preſent, or upon ſuppoſition, and for the future, which diſtinction differs not much from the former. Thus in the State of Innocency, the Law obliged Man abſolutely, and for that preſent time, not to hate, but to love God: But
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93175:27"/>it obliged him to love and relieve the Poor <hi>only for the future,</hi> when there ſhould be, and <hi>on ſuppoſition</hi> that there ſhould be Poor in the World.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) Conſider (Fifthly,) That the Moral Natural Law obliges to ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties immediately, and by it ſelf; but to others only mediately, and by reaſon of ſome other thing intervening. Thus in the State of Innocency, by it ſelf immediately it obliged Man not to hate, but to love and reverence God: But it then obliged him not to eat of the Forbidden Fruit, only <hi>mediately,</hi> and by reaſon of the poſitive Law which forbad it under pain of Death. For it is certain and evident, That without that poſitive Law forbidding it, <hi>the Law of Nature by it ſelf immediately</hi> would never have made it more unlawful to eat of that, than of any other Fruit in the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi> It was therefore that poſitive Law forbidding it, that firſt in order of Nature obliged Man not to eat of it, and then by means of that poſitive Law the Law of Nature alſo came in and obliged Man not to eat of it. The Law of Nature doth not Enact Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Poſitive Laws for us; but when they are Enacted by God, and do oblige us by God's Authority Enacting them, it then obliges us to the obſervance of them. This it did before, and ſtill doth ſince the fall of our Firſt Parents. For the ſame reaſon holds with reſpect to all the poſitive Laws that ever God Enacted for Mankind.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Conſider, Sixthly, That God's Enacting ſome Poſitive Laws, after he had given the Moral Natural Law unto Man in its full perfection, doth not derogate any thing from the full perfection of the ſaid Moral Law, nor from the infinite Wiſdom of God the Soveraign Law-giver. And to ſay and write that for God to make any Poſitive New Law, after he hath given unto Man the Moral Natural Law, is inconſiſtent with the Moral Laws perfection, and with Gods Infinite Wiſdom, is in effect both to diſhonour Gods Law, and to Blaſpheme God's Majeſty. For it is a matter of Fact moſt certainly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, that after the firſt giving unto Man, and concreating with him and in him, the Moral Natural Law; God hath made and given to Man Poſitive Laws both before and ſince the Fall, and before and ſince the Coming of Chriſt. Now if the Enacting of any New Law doth by good conſequence infer the Imperfection of the Moral Natural Law together with the Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God, and the want of Wiſdom in God the Law-give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows alſo by good and neceſſary conſequence, that in truth the Moral Law is not perfect, nor is God Infinitely Wiſe, and ſo he is not God at all; becauſe he hath certainly. Enacted many poſitive New Laws, and theſe poſitive Now Laws argue (as is pretended) that his former Moral Natural Law was not perfect, nor himſelf Wiſe enough to give ſo perfect a Law at firſt, as ſhould anſwer all Emergent Caſes, and prevent the need of any New Law. By this conſideration it manifeſtly appears that ſome Men oppoſe the Goſpels being <hi>a New Law of Grace,</hi> upon ſuch a Principle, as by neceſſary conſequence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ns them into Blaſphemy and Atheiſme; and that their Argument againſt any New Poſitive Law, taken from the Perfection of the Moral Natural Law, and from the Infinite Wiſdom of God, cannot be good, becauſe it is againſt plain Matter of Fact, and attempts to prove that which cannot po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ibly be proved, to wit, That God hath never ſince the firſt Creation Enacted for Men any New Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law; which yet he hath certainly done, if there be any Truth in the Scriptures, either of the Old, or New Teſtament: Yea, this Argument bears ſo high, as to make a ſhew of proving that God cannot do what he hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93175:28"/>done, and if he hath done what he hath done, then he is not, what he is, and what he is ſaid to be, to wit. Infinitely Perfect and Wiſe.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) Conſider Seventhly, That a Duty or Act of ours, which as to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Subſtance of it (ſo to ſpeak) is one and the ſame, may yet have ſeveral Habitudes and Relations, and may fall under ſeveral formal Notions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations; and by reaſon of thoſe different Habitudes, and Notions, may ſo far differ from it ſelf, as to fall under Two different Laws, whereof the One is Moral Natural, and the other is Moral Poſitive: And under one formal No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion and in one reſpect, it may be required of us by a Moral Natural Law; and under another Formal Notion, and in another reſpect, it may be required of us by a Moral Poſitive Law. For inſtance, By one and the ſame Faith conſidered materially, and as to the ſubſtance of it, (ſo to ſpeak),
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> we believe in God, and in the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who is God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Yet there being here Two different Objects, to wit, (1.) God conſidered ſimply as God. (2.) The Mediator between God and Men, Chriſt Jeſus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered now as God Man; and the one being the Ultimate Terminative Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the other the Intermediate Object of our Faith, through which it is carryed unto God as its ultimately Terminative Object. (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>John</hi> 14.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.) I ſay there being here two ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Objects, our Faith as converſant about theſe Two Objects, muſt needs have different Habitudes and Relations, and fall under different formal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Conſiderations. At preſent I ſhall only inſtance in this, That accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Proteſtant Divines. Faith as it relates to God ſimply conſidered, ſo it is a Moral Vertue, or, as others, a Theological Vertue; but as it relates to Chriſt the Mediator, it hath alſo the Notion of a Moral Inſtrument, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Means, or Condition, whereby we are intereſted in Chriſt, or whereby we receive, apprehend, and apply Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs to our ſelves, and whereby we truſt in him, and in God through him, for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation on the account of his Righteouſneſs only. Now the ſame Faith materially conſidered, having ſuch different Objects, and different Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to thoſe Objects, and in different reſpects falling under different formal Notions, it muſt needs by reaſon of them, and as veſted with them, differ formally from it ſelf, though it be materially the ſame Faith ſtill: And then as ſo differing formally from it ſelf, we may very eaſily conceive it to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Laws. Faith in God ſimply conſidered, falls under the Command of the Moral Natural Law, as all confeſs. Faith in Chriſt the Mediator, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally differing from Faith in God ſimply conſidered, falls under the Command of the Moral Poſitive Evangelical Law. So our Proteſtant Divines generally maintain againſt the <hi>Flacian</hi> Sectaries. Witneſs <hi>Melancthon,</hi> who in his Apology for the <hi>Auſburgh</hi> Confeſſion, ſays,

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93175:28"/>Wherefore Faith is fitly called Righteouſneſs.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever is juſtified, he is abſolved by the Law of Chriſt, that is by the Evangelical Law of Chriſt, which preſcribes Faith.</hi> And as was obſerved before, the <hi>Aſſemblies Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> in the <hi>Seventh Chapter,</hi> of Gods Covenant with Man, <hi>Art.</hi> 3. ſaith expreſly, That the Lord in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>requires of Men Faith</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be ſaved. I might bring many more Teſtimonies to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but theſe are ſufficient to ſhow that it hath been, and is the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of our Proteſtant Divines (except ſome raving bawling <hi>Flacians</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Cocceians</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi>) that the Goſpel commands and requires us to believe in Jeſus Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
               <p>The Caſe then is plainly thus, That the Moral Natural Law requires Faith in God, ſimply conſidered as God; and Jeſus Chriſt being God by Nature, One God with the Father and Spirit, it requires Faith in him alſo conſidered ſimply under that formal Notion as God: But the Law doth not <hi>by it ſelf immediately</hi> require Faith in Chriſt the Mediatour, as the inſtrumental means or condition receptive and applicative of him and his Righteouſneſs for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is the Goſpel-Covenant which firſt by it ſelf immediately conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and ordains Faith in the Mediatour Chriſt Jeſus, to be the inſtrumental means or condition receptive and applicative of Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs for Juſtification and Salvation; and which likewiſe requires it of us as ſuch, and under that Notion. Now when Faith in the Mediatour is once by the poſitive Law of Grace or Goſpel-Covenant ordained to ſuch an uſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us for that purpoſe, then I acknowledge that the Moral Natural Law obliges us to obſerve the poſitive Evangelical Law of Grace which hath ordained Faith to ſuch an uſe, and required it in order to ſuch an end; and ſo <hi>mediante Lege Evangelicâ poſitivâ,</hi> by means of the poſitive Evangelical Law of Grace or new Covenant, the Natural Law, the Law of our Creation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to believe in Chriſt the Mediatour, to receive him and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as aforeſaid, and to truſt to be juſtified and ſaved by and for him and his Righteouſneſs only. So that juſtifying Faith in the Mediatour is required of us firſt directly and immediately by the Goſpel Covenant only; but ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, mediately and by conſequence, it is alſo required by the Moral Natural Law. This to me is very evident. For,</p>
               <p n="1">[1.] The Natural Moral Law cannot of it ſelf immediately oblige us to believe in Chriſt the Mediatour, unleſs he be otherwiſe diſcovered to us by Supernatural Revelation. This I think none will deny; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> It is ſimply impoſſible for a Man to believe in Chriſt the Mediatour before he be revealed to him; and he cannot be revealed by the Natural Moral Law,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93175:30"/>without. Supernatural Revelation; therefore he cannot be obliged to believe in Chriſt the Mediatour by the Natural Moral Law immediately, without a Supernatural Revelation; becauſe that juſt and good Law cannot oblige a Man to a ſimple and abſolute impoſſibility. Man in his Innocency could not be obliged by a Natural Law to believe a Supernatural Object, without a Supernatural Revelation.</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] The Supernatural Revelation of Chriſt the Mediatour to us, doth of it ſelf immediately oblige us to believe. It doth not only diſcover Chriſt the Object, but it doth likewiſe <hi>per ſe immediatè,</hi> by it ſelf immediately oblige us to believe the Object revealed; ſo that all Natural Moral Law ſet aſide, and abſtracting from any ſuch Law, the Supernatural Revelation of Chriſt would by it ſelf immediately oblige us to believe: And that,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe it is Gods own Supernatural Teſtimony, which of it ſelf hath an immediate Authority over our Conſcience, and obliges us to believe with a Faith of aſſent. The true formal reaſon and objective moving cauſe of our obligation to believe a Myſterious Truth Supernaturally revealed to us, is the Divine Teſtimony it ſelf, or the Soveraign Authority of God Supernaturally revealing. If any Man ſay, No, it is not that, but it is only the Natural Moral Law which obliges us to believe the Supernatural Tenimony of God: I Anſwer, That ſuch a Man ſeems to be pecking towards the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and does but diſcover his ignorance of thoſe matters. <hi>John</hi> ſays, (1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10.) he that believeth not God hath made him a lyar, <hi>becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</hi> See for this <hi>Eſſen. compend. dogmat. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 284. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 34. <hi>arg.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The ſaid Supernatural Revelation of Chriſt the Mediatour, as God hath given it forth unto Man, carries in it, and with it, a poſitive Command to believe on Chriſt. This is ſo clear in Scripture, that a Man muſt be blind that doth not ſee it, if he do but read, underſtand and conſider. Let <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, 18, 19. be conſulted, and there we ſhall find a Supernatural Revelation of Chriſt the Mediatour, and a Prophetical Promiſe to ſend him into the World. The people were afraid to converſe immediately with God (after the dreadful appearance at the giving of the Law in <hi>Horeb),</hi> therefore they deſired that <hi>Moſes</hi> would be Mediatour between God and them. This motion and deſire of the people God approved of, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. and withal made them a promiſe by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would ſend them the true Mediatour Chriſt, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> in that did but typifie and adumbrate: And at the ſame time, by the ſame <hi>Moſes,</hi> God gave a Command to hearken unto Chriſt when he ſhould come, and backed his Command with a Threatning to puniſh them ſeverely in caſe they did not hearken unto him. Compare this with <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. and it will evidently appear that here we have a Supernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt the Mediatour, which contains in it a plain Command to hear him in all things; and that hearing him in all things, includes believing on him, (<hi>John</hi> 8.24. and 14.1.); and the Command is enforced with a dreadful Threatning againſt every Soul which will not hear him, and believe on him. Now doth not this Supernatural Revelation by vertue of the Command in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in it, immediately oblige us, to believe on Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation? Surely none but an Unbeliever can deny this. And it not only doth oblige us, but it would oblige us, ſuppoſe (that which is impoſſible) that there were no Natural Moral Law in the World. We have then a poſitive Law which immediately obliges our Conſcience to believe in Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93175:30"/>beſides the Natural Moral Law. And thus was this matter underſtood above Twelve Hundred Years ago. Witneſs that of <hi>Lactantius;</hi>

In</hi> Deuteronomy <hi>he left it thus written, And the Lord ſaid unto me, I will raiſe them up a Prophet from among their Brethren, like unto thee, and I will put my Word in his Mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto them thoſe things which I ſhall command him: And whoſoever ſhall not hear thoſe things which that Prophet ſhall ſpeak in my Name, I will puniſh him for it. God declared even by the Law giver himſelf, that he would ſend his own Son, that is, a Living and Preſent Law, and would abrogate that Old Law, given by a Mortal Man; that he might by him who ſhould be Eternal, again Confirm and Ratifie the Eternal Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he, and whoever is acquainted with the Writings of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> may (I think) eaſily perceive that by the Eternal Law, he meant the Everlaſting Goſpel or Covenant, and Law of Grace which the Eternal Chriſt hath Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and Ratified by his Blood ſhedding and Death.</p>
               <p>This may appear yet clearer to ſome Perſons from <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.5. <hi>And behold a Voice out of the Cloud which ſaid, This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> Where again, We have (1.) A Supernatural Revelation of Chriſt as the Son of God. (2.) We have a poſitive Command of God, to hear him, that is to believe on him, and obey him, as the word (<hi>hear</hi>) ſignifies, according to the <hi>Hebrew idiom.</hi> Now this Voice out of the Cloud was not the Voice of the Law of Nature, but of the Father as ſuch, ſpeaking by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation; nor was this a Command of the Law of Nature, but it was a poſitive Command of God, as the Authour of Grace, which poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand recorded in Scripture, is to us Chriſtians a poſitive Law, whatever it be to Unbelievers; It is a poſitive Law which obliges us to Faith in Chriſt by the Evidence of Supernatural Revelation applying the Veracity and Authority of God to our Conſciences. Such it was to <hi>Melancthon,</hi> one of our firſt Reformers, who often hath recourſe to it as a Command of the Goſpel diſtinct from the Natural Moral Law. Particularly he hath recourſe to it twice in his Anſwer to the 22th. <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Inquiſition. And as the foreſaid Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelations carryed in them a Poſitive Command expreſly; ſo the firſt obſcurer Revelation of that kind, (that <hi>the Seed of the Woman,</hi> ſhould bruiſe the Serpents Head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.) implyed the like Poſitive Command to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt to come; though it be not ſo expreſs in the firſt Written Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord as it is conveyed down to us.

               </p>
               <p>But I inſiſt not on that. It is ſufficient to our purpoſe, that we now have a Supernatural clear Revelation of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31.</note> with a clear expreſs poſitive Command to believe on him, and that diſtinct from the Natural Moral Law. And this expreſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command, <hi>(Hear ye him, believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved)</hi> is to us an Evangelical Law, which hath more Power over our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences than Ten Thouſand ſuch little Sophiſmes ſet off with a Rhetorical Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Words, as are offered us to prove, That we are not obliged to believe in Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation, by the Goſpel Covenant or Law of Grace, but only by the Natural Moral Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the Opinion under Conſideration, is not true, becauſe contrary to plain Scripture, ſo it is of worſe conſequence to Religion, than my Reverend Brother ſeems to be aware of; For if there be no Poſitive Law in the Goſpel, diſtinct from the Natural Law, which obliges us to Faith in Chriſt; becauſe if there were, then the Natural Moral Law would not be perfect, and preſcribe all Duty, nor would God be Infinitely Wiſe; it follows by the ſame reaſon that there is no poſitive Law at all, which obligeth us to any other Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and indeed by this <hi>Flacian</hi> Opinion he plainly overthrows all Poſitive Laws, and therewith all Inſtituted Worſhip. And he is miſtaken, if he think to prevent and remedy this, by reducing all to the Natural Moral Law. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If there be no Poſitive Law at all, then it can never be reduced to the Natural Moral Law. For a thing that is not at all, cannot be reduced to a thing that really is.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Natural Moral <hi>Law</hi> would never oblige us to any the leaſt part of Poſitive Inſtituted Worſhip, if we were not firſt in order of Nature obliged to it by the poſitive Will of God inſtituting it, and by the Inſtitution it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obliging us to the obſervance of it. Once take away the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ariſes immediately from the poſitive Inſtitution, and the <hi>Law</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Moral Natural Law will never take hold of our Conſciences to oblige us thereunto. For it is by means of the Special Poſitive Law, that the General Natural Law obliges to ſuch and ſuch particular kind of things, which fall not under the Commands of the general Natural Law. Is it not very evident, that though <hi>Adam,</hi> before he ſinned had the Moral Natural Law in its full perfection, yet it would never have obliged his Conſcience to forbear Eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, more than any other Fruit in the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> If to the General Natural Law, God had not ſuper-added a particular poſitive Law, forbidding him under pain of Death to eat of the Fruit of that Tree: So that it was this New Poſitive Law which firſt obliged him not to eat of it, and then by Vertue of that, The Moral Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law ſtrictly obliged him likewiſe not to eat of it. And this holds Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally with reſpect to every thing that depends on the Arbitrary Will of God to make it our Duty or not. It is his Poſitive Law, ſignifying his Will and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93175:31"/>Pleaſure, that firſt obliges us, and then by vertue thereof, God's General Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law obliges us alſo; and not otherwiſe. So that upon this abſurd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, if it ſhould prevail amongſt us, we muſt all turn Seventh day-Men and Quakers; for we ſhall never be able to prove by any, or all of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, without a Poſitive Law expreſly or implicitly inſtituting them, and ſtill in force; That the Firſt Day of the Week is the Chriſtian Sabbath, That we ought to be Baptized with Water in the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and to Eat and Drink the Bleſſed Bread and Wine in remembrance of Chriſt's Death till he come.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall ſubjoyn the Teſtimony of the Late Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and then paſs on. From <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. he infers that Chriſt was to be a Law giver. His words are [

                  <q>The Prophet here foretold, was to be like unto him <hi>(Moſes)</hi> wherein he was peculiar and exempted from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with all other Prophets, which were to build on his Foundation, without adding any thing to the Rule of Faith and Worſhip which he had Revealed, or changing any thing therein.

               <p>Now as I have diſtinguiſhed of Faith, ſo I diſtinguiſh of Repentance. As there is a Faith in God which moſt certainly is commanded by the Natural Moral Law it ſelf immediately; ſo there is a Repentance towards God, which is alſo Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Natural Moral <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf immediately. This I never denyed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed, and in our Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 200. we plainly enough profeſſed this our belief in theſe words, <q>[Heathens who never heard, nor could hear of the Goſpel for want of an Objective Revelation of it, they living and dying <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance and Faith in the True God,</hi> under the guilt of <hi>Sins againſt the Law, and Light of Nature,</hi> will be <hi>Condemned by the Law, but not by the Goſpel,</hi> which they could not know, <hi>Rom</hi> 2.12.]</q> Theſe words plainly ſhow, that our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That Heathens are guilty of Sins againſt the <hi>Law</hi> and Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in that they do not believe in the True God, nor repent of their Sins, although they have not the Goſpel, and ſo no Goſpel-Promiſe to aſſure them of Pardon; and that they ſhall be Condemned by the Law of Nature for their Unbelief and Impenitency againſt the Law of Nature, together with their other Sins againſt the ſame Law. And from this it appears, That a great part of my Reverend Brothers Seventh Chapter, is altogether Impertinent, and that I am not at all concerned in it. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> here fights againſt a Man of Straw of his own making and ſetting up, and valiantly runs him down again, and I do not in the leaſt envy him the Glory of ſuch a Victory. But though the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Moral Law doth oblige all Mankind of ripe years to a Natural Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that is, (1.) To be heartily ſorry for having offended God their Creator and Preſerver, by breaking his Law which they are under, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93175:32"/>alſo to expreſs the inward ſorrow of their Hearts. (2) To hate their Sin as a great Evil in it ſelf, and the procuring Cauſe of Evil unto Men. (3.) Not to act their Sin over again, but to abſtain from Sin, and to keep God's Natural Moral Law for the future: Yet there is another kind of Repentance which the Natural Moral Law doth not by it ſelf immediately oblige all Mankind unto in all parts of the World, and that is an Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which ariſeth from an apprehenſion and perſwaſion of God's Mercy in Chriſt to all ſuch as are truely Penitent, and to our ſelves, if we do, or ſhall truely Repent. This is a Repentance towards God conſidered not meerly as our Creator, Preſerver and Ruler; but as in Chriſt reconciling the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, and as Ruling Graciouſly and Mercifully by Chriſt. So that it hath a formal Object different from that of the other Natural Legal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and it hath likewiſe a different Habitude and Relation unto God, and is carryed out unto him after a different manner, which is ſufficient to give it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Form, and to make it formally to differ from the foreſaid Natural Legal Repentance: Moreover, it hath another Office and Uſe aſſigned to it, for it is conſtituted and Ordained by God through Chriſt to be <hi>a Condition Diſpoſitive</hi> of the Subject to be pardoned, or a means to prepare and qualifie us for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Pardon of our Sins by Faith in Chriſt's Blood, and for his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs only, apprehended, applyed, and truſted to by Faith. <hi rend="margQuotes">Now ſuch a Repentance as this, a True Evangelical Repentance, conſidered under this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal notion, as ariſing from the foreſaid perſwaſion of Gods Mercy in Chriſt to the truely Penitent; and as a Condition or Means to diſpoſe and prepare for pardon, and as having pardon enſured to it by Promiſe through Chriſt: I ſay Repentance of this kind, and conſidered under this Notion, is Commanded and Required by the Goſpel-Law or Covenant, firſtly, directly, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; and then by the Natural Moral Law mediately, and by conſequence.</hi> As the Goſpel Commands us to believe that God is upon terms of Saving, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy to the truely Penitent, ſo the Goſpel, or God by the Goſpel, makes True Repentance to be one of the Terms, to be a Condition or Means to diſpoſe and qualifie us for pardoning Mercy; and makes Pardon ſure to us by Promiſe through Chriſt upon our Repentance: As alſo, It is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and God by Goſpel, that requires the ſaid diſpoſitive Condition, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to Repent, that we may certainly obtain the Promiſed Pardon, through Faith in Chriſt's Blood.</p>
               <p>That God by the Goſpel Commands us to Repent, in order to obtain the Pardon of our Sins, is as Clear as the Light at Noon, to all that are not blind through Unbelief. For doth not the Evangelical Prophet ſay, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him Return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon:</hi> Or, <hi>He will multiply to Pardon.</hi> It cannot be ſaid, That this is the Voice of the firſt Covenant and Law of Works. For that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſo far from requiring Repentance as a means to obtain Pardon of Sin, that it doth not ſo much as admit of Repentance as any means to ſuch an end, as we ſhall hear by and by from Mr. <hi>Caryll.</hi> And if it be not the Voice of the Old Covenant and Law of Works, it muſt be the Voice of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Law of Grace; for there is no Medium, no Third that can have any place here. And it is obſervable, that here Repentance is required in the firſt place, and then Pardon is promiſed as a great favour, which ſhall follow after.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93175:32"/>For the Promiſe runs in the Future Tenſe, the Lord <hi>will</hi> have Mercy upon the wicked Man who hath truly repented, and our God <hi>will</hi> abundantly pardon him. He will pardon him all the Sins, whereof he hath truly repented, how many ſoever they have been.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> our Lord himſelf and his Apoſtles began their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel with the Preaching of Repentance, ſo when our Lord Chriſt after his Reſurrection enlarged the Apoſtles Commiſſion, and ſent them to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, he told them, that they muſt preach Repentance and Remiſſion of Sin; in his Name among all Nations, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 24.47. So that it was a part of their Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel, that they ſhould preach Repentance as a means to obtain Remiſſion of Sins through Faith in Chriſts name. And it is certain that they acted according to their Commiſſion. <hi>Peter</hi> led the way; and in his firſt Sermon after they were endued with Power from on high; he ſaid to the convinced humbled <hi>Jews,</hi> (who asked him and the reſt of the Apoſtles what they ſhould do?) <hi>That they ſhould repent and be baptized every one of them in the name of Jeſus Christ for the remiſſion of ſins, Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. Thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> were deeply convinced that they had broken the Law, and thereby fallen under its curſe, and deſtroyed their own Souls; ſo that it was not then time to preach the Old Law of Works to them; nor did <hi>Peter</hi> preach it then to them, but he preached the Goſpel-Covenant and New Law of Grace to them, ſaying as before mentioned, <hi>Repent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And by that firſt Goſpel-Sermon he converted about Three Thouſand Souls. And as he began ſo he continued to do; for his next publick Sermon to the people was of the ſame ſtrain with the firſt; for after he and his Brethren had born their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to Chriſts Reſurrection, and by his Reſurrection and the Miracle done in his Name had proved him to be indeed the true Chriſt whom God promiſed to ſend into the World for the Redemption of his People: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after he had charged them with, and proved them guilty of the murder of Chriſt, and had ſhewed that by ignorantly murdering Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> they had unwittingly fulfilled the many Propheſies which foretold the ſufferings of Chriſt for the Salvation of his People; he immediately commanded and exhorted them to repent and be converted, as the means to obtain the Pardon of their Sins, and Salvation of their Souls. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> And here by the way we may take notice that the antient <hi>Syriack</hi> Interpreter renders this place thus; [<hi>Repent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, and</hi> that <hi>the times of refreſhing may come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>]

                  <hi>[Repent therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, and that the times of the Lords refreſhing may come unto you.]</hi> So <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> But I lay not the ſtreſs of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument on that Old Tranſlation; for our own Tranſlation is ſufficient to my purpoſe, ſince it plainly ſhews, That the Goſpel preſcribes Repentance unto Sinners, as a means to prepare and diſpoſe them for obtaining the Pardon of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93175:33"/>their Sins; which the Natural Moral Law by it ſelf immediately doth not do; but only requires a Natural Legal Repentance, ſuch as is before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that Men ſhould ſo ſin no more for time to come; but doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain it <hi>to be a means,</hi> nor require it <hi>as a means</hi> to obtain pardon, nor yet enſure pardon to it through Chriſt, as ſuch a means.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Peter</hi> led the way in preaching the Goſpel, by preaching Repentance as a means to obtain pardon of Sin; ſo the other Apoſtles followed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Commiſſion which they all received from the Lord himſelf. <hi>Paul</hi> (as was ſhewn in the <hi>Apology</hi>) was ſent to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. And he was faithful to the Lord who ſent him, and approved himſelf ſo to be, by teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and alſo to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> Repentance towards God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 21. And the end in order to which he preached up the uſe of theſe means of Faith and Repentance, was that people might receive forgiveneſs of Sins. And if that was not Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching, how can it be proved that ever there was ſuch a thing as Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching in the World; and that <hi>Paul</hi> was faithful to God and the Souls of Men in preaching the Goſpel; ſince Repentance towards God, and Faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that too in order to pardon of Sin, to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation were the two great heads of Doctrine that he mainly inſiſted upon: as evidently appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 21. And that the other Apoſtles preached the ſame Goſpel, in the ſame way, and to the ſame end, it is needleſs to go about to prove it, ſince they had all one Commiſſion, and were all faithful in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to their Commiſſion. Now as this was Goſpel in the days of the Apoſtles, ſo it hath been, and ſtill is, and ever will be Goſpel to the end of the World: For Chriſts Goſpel is an everlaſting Goſpel, and in all Ages hath been preſerved and continued in the Church, and hath been preached (as to the ſum and ſubſtance of it) by certain faithful Miniſters of Chriſt in all Ages. <hi>Lactantius</hi> of old gave this as a mark to know the true Church by:

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93175:34"/>places, That the Particle <hi>[gratis]</hi> freely, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. doth not exclude Faith, but excludes the condition of our own worthineſs, and transfers the cauſe of the benefit from us unto Chriſt; and moreover having ſaid that the Particle <hi>(freely)</hi> doth neither exclude our own Obedience, but only transfers the cauſe of the benefit from the worth of our Obedience unto Chriſt, that the benefit may be ſure: Finally having ſaid that the Goſpel preaches Repentance, but that our reconciliation may be iure, it teaches that our Sins are pardoned, and that we pleaſe God, not for the dignity or merit of our Repentance, or newneſs of Heart and Life, but for Chriſts ſake only; and that this conſolation is neceſſary to pious Conſciences. From the premiſſes he makes his inference in theſe words following;

The Goſpel then is a preaching of Repentance and a Promiſe, which Reaſon doth not naturally attain unto,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Melancthon;</hi> and I could quote more out of his Writings to this purpoſe: but this is enough. He who cannot ſee by this little, that <hi>Melancthon</hi> believed the Goſpel requires Repentance of us in order to pardon of Sin, ſeems to be like thoſe of whom <hi>Lactantius</hi> of old in the <hi>Seventh Book</hi> and <hi>Firſt Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> ſaid that they will not believe our Doctrine, <hi>[Nec ſi Solem quidem ipſum geſtemus in manibus], No not though we carry before them even the Sun it ſelf in our hands;</hi> that is, though we bring them the cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence imaginable:

               <p>As for <hi>Luther,</hi> ſince he approved and ſubſcribed the <hi>Ausburgh</hi> Confeſſion, we may from it take an eſtimate of his Judgment: And beſides that, <hi>Chemnicius</hi> in his common places, <hi>page</hi> 219, 220. ſhews out of <hi>Luthers</hi> firſt Diſputation againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> That he alſo held that Repentance taken intirely in its eſſential perfection, is required by the Goſpel. I wiſh <hi>Luther</hi> had been ſomething more accurate in the handling of that matter; but as it is, it ſufficeth to ſhow that he was far from thinking that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Repentance is required by the Natural Moral Law only, and not at all by the Goſpel; and that on the contrary he believed that Evangelical Repentance as Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, is from the Goſpel, and not from the Law.</p>
               <p>And ſo the <hi>Lutherans</hi> generally (except the <hi>Flacians,</hi> if there be yet any of that Sect remaining in <hi>Germany</hi>) maintain that Evangelical Repentance as Evangelical is required by the Goſpel. And I wonder not at all to find them unanimous in this, ſo far as I am acquainted with their Writings; becauſe after <hi>Melancthon,</hi> they hold Faith to be an eſſential part, yea to be the <hi>eſſentiating form</hi> of Evangelical Repentance. I am not indeed of their mind in this; yet I think it is a truth, that though Faith be not the very eſſential form it ſelf of Evangelical Repentance, yet it contributes much towards the giving its ſpecifical form, and the making it truly Evangelical; and without Faith it would not be Evangelical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> and his Followers differ from the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in this, That they make not Faith to be an Eſſential part of Repentance, but hold them to be Two diſtinct Graces co-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent and influential the one upon the other.

(2.) <hi>Calvin</hi> here ſaith, That the Goſpel requires nothing but Faith to <hi>receive</hi> the Grace of God. And ſo we ſay the very ſame thing.

As for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance it is not of that Nature, it is not naturally ſitted for, nor is it by God appointed and ordained to that uſe and Office in the matter of Juſtification; but it is only fitted for, and ordained unto this Uſe and Office to be the Means or Condition diſpoſitive of the ſubject (man) which is to be pardoned and Juſtifyed.

               </p>
               <p>But we will leave the <hi>Germans,</hi> and come to our own Countrey Men, and ſee what their Judgment hath been of this matter. And I will begin with Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> whoſe Judgment, I hope, will be ſomething regarded by the Brethren. He gives it plainly, and fully, on <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. laſt Vol. in <hi>Quarto, pag.</hi> 842, where that Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as a means of obtaining Pardon and Life, is not required by the Law, but by the Goſpel, he proves, (1.) <q>By Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2, 11. and 4.17. and <hi>Mark</hi> 6.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. (2.) He ſays, It is through the Goſpel only that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is poſſible, and this appears two ways. (1.) Becauſe we have not a liberty to repent, or we are not admitted to repent but by the Goſpel; we find no place for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the Law ſtrictly taken, or as oppoſed to the Goſpel. The Law ſpeaks thus, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Where we ſee (1.) The Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Perſonal Obedience, every one muſt do for himſelf. (2.) The Law requires perpetual Obedience, (every one that continueth not doing) (3.) The Law requires Univerſal Obedience. (every one that continueth not in all things.) The Law doth not ſay, If a Man continue not to do all, let him repent; that admits no ſecond Thoughts, but claps the Curſe preſently upon the Offender. If <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as he had eaten of the forbidden Tree, had bewailed his Sin, and ſaid, I repent, no Favour could have been ſhewed him while under the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Thus the Reverend Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> whereby it plainly appears that he believed the Law by it ſelf immediately doth not oblige us to Repentance as it is a means by God's Ordination, diſpoſing us to obtain Pardon of Sin, and acceptance with God through Faith in Chriſt: for he plainly ſays, <hi>That the Law doth not admit us to repent in order to ſuch an end:</hi> And then ſurely it doth not Command us to repent in order to ſuch an end. On the other hand he proves by Scripture, that the Goſpel Commands us to Repent in order to the foreſaid end. And therefore he is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our ſide againſt my Reverend Brother.</p>
               <p>So are the Reverend Authours of the Aſſemblyes Annotations. Annotation on <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. "Repent ye.] <hi>Faith and Repentance</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are the ſum of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Annotators, in their Annotation on <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. But <hi>now he Commandeth all Men every where to repent</hi>] they ſay [now he cauſeth the Goſpel to be preached to all Nations to draw them from their horrible Sins: And now if they refuſe to do the known Will of their Maſter, they muſt expect more ſevere Judgments] Hence it is manifeſt that in the Judgment of thoſe Divines, the Command to repent in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pardon of Sin, is a part of the Goſpel, otherwiſe their Annotation had been imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; yea, it had been a wreſting of Holy Scripture, and a perverting of the true meaning of the Text, which they deſigned to explain. But ſome may demand whether our Proteſtant Divines uſe to ſay that True Repentance is a Condition required of us as neceſſary, yea, and as antecedently neceſſary in order of Nature, to the obtaining Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin? I Anſwer, Yea, they do uſe to ſay ſo, and ſome of them prove it too.

It is abſurd (ſaith he) to believe a Remiſſion of Sins which are not yet committed, for neither in the Decree of God is there an <hi>actual</hi> Remiſſion Decreed without Repentance <hi>preceding</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The ſame <hi>Burgeſs</hi> in the ſame Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 270. gives us his own Judgment, by it ſelf in theſe following words, <q>[There is in Scripture a two-fold Repentance, or Humiliation for Sin; the one <hi>antecedent,</hi> and <hi>going before Pardon,</hi> and this the Scripture requireth as a <hi>neceſſary Condition,</hi> without which Forgiveneſs of Sin cannot be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Of this Repentance the Scripture for the moſt part ſpeaks, <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. and generally in moſt places of Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> By this now it appears that both <hi>Rivet</hi> and <hi>Burgeſs</hi> held that True Repentance is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Condition or Means <hi>antecedently</hi> in order of Nature neceſſary to the Pardon of Sin.</p>
               <p>Our Third Witneſs is the Learned, Prudent, Pious and Peaceable Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> who in his Commentary on the <hi>Revelation</hi> hath a large Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Repentance;</hi> where (1.) He diſtinguiſhes and ſhews what Repentance it is which he holds to be neceſſary to pardon of Sin. (2.) He proves it to be neceſſary, ſimply neceſſary, yea and antecedently neceſſary in order of Nature to the obtaining pardon of Sin. His Arguments are diſtributed into three Claſſes. Some of them prove its neceſſity, others prove its antecedency. All together ſtrongly prove that it's antecedently neceſſary in order of Nature to the obtaining of Pardon. This is to be ſeen in <hi>pag.</hi> 249, 250. (3.) He enquires whether Repentance may be called a Condition, as well as Faith? And Anſwers that it may not be called a Condition <hi>in the ſame Senſe,</hi> as Faith is called one. For Faith is the only Condition whereby we cloſe with the Covenant, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we cloſe with, receive, and apply Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs as held forth to us in the Covenant-Promiſe. But then he ſays, That <hi>in a large Senſe it may be called, and it is a Condition neceſſary with Faith concomitantly in the ſame ſubject, to qualifie and diſpoſe it in a congruous ſuitable way to receive Pardon of Sin by Faith in Chriſt alone.</hi> This is to be ſeen in <hi>pag.</hi> 253, 254, 255, 256. And this is the ſame thing which we believe and have openly profeſſed to the World in our Apology: So that there is not an hairs breadth of difference between his judgment and mine, except it be in the wording of it. And this manifeſtly appears from our calling Repentance the Condition or Means which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifies and diſpoſes the <hi>Subject</hi> for receiving Pardon by Faith alone; whereas we call Faith the Inſtrumental Means or Condition, whereby we receive and apply the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> to wit, the Promiſe, and Chriſt with his Righteouſneſs as held forth to us in the Promiſe for Juſtification and Salvation. This is ſufficient to ſhow that Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93175:36"/>of the ſame Judgment with us as to this matter, and that therefore we juſtly bring him in to Witneſs for us. I would have quoted his own words, but they are ſo many, and would ſwell my Diſcourſe to ſuch a Bulk, that I chooſe rather to refer the Reader to the Book and Pages, where he will ſee (if he be in any doubt) that I have faithfully given his Senſe in few words.</p>
               <p>Our Fourth Witneſs ſhall be the Famous Confeſſion of Faith, Compoſed by the moſt Learned of the Reformed Divines of <hi>Poland, Lithuania,</hi> and the <hi>Provinces</hi> thereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; together with Divines from <hi>Germany;</hi> and which they gave in at <hi>Torn</hi> in the Year 1645, unto the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctors, all Aſſembled there to Confer about Religion for ſeveral Moneths together. Their words are theſe,
<note n="(x)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Non controvertitur hîc an ad remiſſionem peccatorum requiratur converſio mentis ad Deum, &amp; interna peccatorum dum dolore deteſtatio; aſſerimuus enim talem poenitentiam, ut perpetuam conditionem, ad peccatorum remiſſionem requiſitam fuiſſe in utroque Teſtamento, qua peccator non quidem eam meretur (hoc enim efficit ſolum meritum &amp; ſatisfactio Chriſti, cum eam nobis fide viva applicamus) ſed per eam</hi> praerequiſita conditio <hi>impletur, quâ</hi> aptus <hi>fit at Divinam</hi> miſericordiam <hi>conſequendam.

D. 1645. Cap. 6. <hi>De Sacramentis,</hi> Sect. <hi>De Poenitentiâ.</hi>
                  </note> (1.) <hi>It is not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted here, whether the Converſion of the Mind to God, and the inward Deteſtation of Sins with Sorrow, be required unto the Remiſſion of Sins, for we aſſert that, as a perpetual Condition unto the Remiſſion of Sins, ſuch a Repentance was required under both Teſtaments, whereby a Sinner doth not indeed merit it (for the alone Merit and Satisfaction of Chriſt doth that, when we apply it to our ſelves by a lively Faith) but by it the pre-required Condition is performed whereby he is made fit and diſpoſed to obtain the Divine Mercy.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Thus that Confeſſion of Faith, and thoſe many Learned Judicious Divines who drew it up, bear witneſs to the Truth with us, That Repentance is pre-required, and always was pre-required as a neceſſary <hi>Condition</hi> whereby a Sinner is <hi>qualified</hi> and <hi>made meet</hi> to receive the Pardon of his Sins by Faith in Chriſt's Blood. I could bring more Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies both from the Word of God, and the Writings of Holy, Sound, and Orthodox Miniſters of Chriſt, for the Confirmation and Elucidation of this Truth, but I have been too large already upon this Point, and therefore this may ſuper abundantly ſuffice to ſhow, That though the Natural Moral Law oblige all Mankind in all parts of the World to one ſort of Faith and Repentance; yet there is another ſort of them, there is an Evangelical Faith and Repentance, unto which the Evangelical Law of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant doth only by it ſelf immediately oblige us; And the Moral Natural Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to them but mediately only, and by conſequence, in as much as it obliges us to obſerve all God's Poſitive Laws which it pleaſeth him at any time to Enact for us.</p>
               <p>Conſider <hi>(Eighthly,)</hi> That under the Goſpel God hath made ſincere Obedience to his Moral Natural Law, and to all his Poſitive Laws which are in Force and not Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, one of the Articles of the New Covenant taken in its Latitude; He hath made our performance of ſuch ſincere Obedience to his Laws, a Condition neceſſary to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and prepare us for obtaining full poſſeſſion of Eternal Life and Happineſs in Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory, for the ſake of Chriſt and his Meritorious Righteouſneſs only.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) For clearing of this, It is to be obſerved, that in the firſt federal Law of Works given and preſcribed unto Man before the Fall, there are Three things to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. (1.) There is the preceptive part of it. (2.) The Minatory Sanction. (3.) The Promiſſory Sanction.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) There is the Preceptive part, which obligeth to Duty, and except the Poſitive Precepts of Sanctiſying or keeping Holy to God the Seventh day preciſely in order from the Creation, and of not eating the Forbidden Fruit; All the reſt of the Preceptive part of that Law of Works is in force ſtill, and obliges Mankind to an Ever Sinleſs Obedience <hi>de futuro.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93175:36"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) There is the Minatory Sanction, or Threatning which binds over Tranſgreſſors to ſuffer the Puniſhment threatned. And this is ſtill in force with reſpect to all Impent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Unbelievers. They are all whil'ſt they continue in that State, under the Curſe of the firſt broken Law and Covenant; and are lyable to a further degree of the ſame Puniſhment for every Sin which they ſhall commit in this World. Yet by the Goſpel there is a Door of Hope, to get out of this State opened through Chriſt unto thoſe to whom God ſends it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) There is the Promiſſory Sanction, or the Promiſe of Life, unto thoſe who keep the Precepts without any Sin whatſoever. Now this is not in force ſince the fall, ſo as that any Man ſhould be obliged <hi>(ex intentione Dei)</hi> to believe or hope that he ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Eternal Life by his keeping the Preceptive part of the firſt Covenant or Law of Works. This was briefly explained and proved in the Apology, <hi>pag.</hi> 200, 201. and it might be further confirmed, if it were needful. But it is not needful, becauſe to a Man who knows himſelf to be a Sinner, and underſtands the Nature of that firſt Law, (as every Man of common underſtanding may do,) it is ſelf-evident that that Law condemns him to Death for his Sin; and that it is ſimply impoſſible for him to be juſtified unto Life, by that very Law which every moment condemns him to death. And yet it muſt be confeſſed, that the firſt Law or Covenant of Works as fortiſied with its Promiſſory Sanction is repeated both in the Old and New Teſtament, where the Scripture ſaith to Sinful Man, <hi>Do this and live, Levit.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. But we muſt know that this was <hi>Occonomical,</hi> and Gods deſign in it was not to oblige any ſinful Man to ſeek or expect Life by his doing the Works of the firſt Law and Covenant, which Promiſed Life to Man only on condition that he ſo kept it, as never to ſin at all, nor by Sin to break it. But then you will ſay, What was Gods deſign in it? I anſwer, That ſo far as the Lord hath given me light to ſee into this matter, his deſign ſeems to have been (1.) By ſetting before us the form of the Firſt Covenant of Works, to recal to our minds what Man once was, and what he ſhould ſtill have been: That once he was without all Sin, and able to have continued ſo; and to have lived for ever, by keeping Covenant, with God. (2.) To convince us that now we are all in our Natural State, Dead Men by that very Law and Covenant, which would have ſecured Life to us, if we had perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept it, but now brings us all under the guilt of Death, Temporal and Eternal Death, becauſe we have broken it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) To ſtir us up to confeſs our Sin and Miſery, and to put us upon ſearching, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God hath in Mercy provided any remedy againſt our Sin and Miſery. (4.) To make us willing to receive and uſe the Remedy, as ſoon as God diſcovers it to us. In a word, to make us deſpair of ever obtaining Life by the Works of that Law which condemns us to death for our ſins; and to make us flee for Refuge unto Chriſt our Help and Hope, as God offers him to us in the New Covenant or Law of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">(2dly) It is to be obſerved, That as ſoon as any Man takes this courſe, aſſoon as any Man takes hold of the New Covenant of Grace, and heartily and ſincerely by Faith cloſes with, and receives Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs as offered and held forth in the ſaid New Covenant, he is inſtantly acquitted from the guilt of Death, he was under for breaking the Law, and hath a Right to Life given him only on the account of the Lord Redeemer Chriſt, and his Satisfactory, Meritorious Righteouſneſs received and applyed by Faith alone: And ſo he is juſtifyed by Faith without Works; For though Faith in Chriſt the Mediator <hi>be in it ſelf a Heart-work,</hi> yet it is not the Works of the Law, it is <hi>not any of thoſe Works</hi> which the Firſt Covenant or Law of Works <hi>did require to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It is neither a Work which the Natural Moral Law <hi>by it ſelf immediately</hi> required, nor yet is it a Work <hi>in the Senſe</hi> of the Law of Works; for Works in the ſenſe of that Law and Covenant, they ſignifie that Obedience to the Law, whereby a Man in his own perſon fulſills the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and that <hi>for which</hi> a Man is juſtified. But Faith is not a Work in that Senſe, for as much as <hi>it is no part</hi> at all of that Obedience
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93175:37"/>which ſulfills the Law, and <hi>for which</hi> a penitent Believer is juſtified. It is only Chriſts Obedience unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, <hi>for</hi> which Believers are juſtified, and <hi>Faith is no part of it,</hi> but is the only inſtrumental means, or receptive applicative condition whereby we come to <hi>have intereſt in it,</hi> and to be juſtified <hi>by and for</hi> it alone.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It is to be obſerved, that though upon our firſt taking hold of Gods New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Law of Grace by Faith, we are for Chriſts ſake alone inſtantly acquitted from the guilt of Death, and receive a right to Life; yet God hath made it one of the Articles of the new Covenant, that according to our time and talents we muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yield ſincere Obedience to his ſeveral Laws and Inſtitutions, both Moral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and Poſitive, before we be admitted to full poſſeſſion of Eternal Life in Heavenly Glory. God doth not require this ſincere Obedience in order to our being firſt juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but in order to our being at laſt glorified. And he requires it as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to qualifie and prepare us for the full poſſeſſion of that Heavenly Glory which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, and God for Chriſts ſake gives unto us.</p>
               <p>Hence (4.) It is to be obſerved, That thus the Moral Natural Law it ſelf comes to be in the hand of Chriſt the Mediatour of the new Covenant or Law of Grace; and to belong to the Goſpel <hi>ſo far</hi> as that ſincere Obedience to it, together with all Gods poſitive Laws and Inſtitutions, is made an Article of the Goſpel Covenant, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition neceſſary to be performed by us before we enjoy the ultimate benefit promiſed in the ſaid Covenant.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) It is to be obſerved, That we muſt diſtinguiſh carefully betwixt what the Moral Law, as to the <hi>matter</hi> of its Precepts, requires of Believers, and what it requires as coming under a <hi>new ferm;</hi> that is, plainly, as cloathed with a new ſanction, to wit, the ſanction of the new Covenant. In the firſt ſenſe, the Moral Law, as to the matter of its Precepts, doth ſtill require of all, even of Believers, a perfect ever ſinleſs Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>de futuro;</hi> but there is this vaſt difference between the caſe of Believers and Unbelievers, that though for every the leaſt diſobedience it condemn the Unbeliever, yet doth it not, nor can it, condemn the true penirent Believer, who walks not after the Fleſh but the Spirit; becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, Rom.</hi> 8.1. ſuch are not under the Law (not under its condemmng power) but under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. In the ſecond ſenſe, the Moral Law formally conſidered, as cloathed with the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant form, that is, with the ſanction of the new Covenant; ſo it requires not of true penitent Believers an ever ſinleſs and moſt perfect perſonal perpetual Obedience, <hi>as a means or condition neceſſary</hi> to qualifie and prepare them for the poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory; but it requires of them, or God by it, as taken into the Goſpel, requires of them only ſincere Evangelical Obedience, perſeverance in true Faith and ſincere Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>under that formal conſideration, as a means or condition neceſſary</hi> to the end aforeſaid. This I think I proved clearly both by Scripture and Reaſon in the <hi>Apology.</hi> And I need to ſay no more of that matter, till what I have there written be ſolidly anſwered; which I never expect to ſee done.</p>
               <p>Yet before I paſs from this eighth Conſideration, I will <hi>ex ſuperabundanti</hi> confirm what is here aſſerted by ſome few Teſtimonies both Divine and Humane: But firſt I muſt deſire the Reader to turn to the 103 and 104 Pages of the <hi>Apology,</hi> and to read attentively, and rightly underſtand what I there quoted out of the Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Turretin,</hi> who ſhows that the New Covenant and Goſpel comprehends both the Promiſe of Juſtification, and the Promiſe of Glorification; and that it requires more in order to the obtaining of Glorification in Heaven, than to the obtaining of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation on Earth. He ſhows alſo, that we ought to diſtinguiſh between the firſt cloſing with and entering into Covenant, and the keeping of the Covenant we are entred into. Faith enters us into the Covenant by receiving the promiſes; and Faith together with
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93175:37"/>ſincere Obedience, as its fruit and effect, keeps the Covenant by retaining the Promiſes, and Evangelically fulfilling the Commands. Now the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being made for, and propounded to us by God who is infinitely ſuperiour to us, and has a Soveraign Authority over us, it obliges us both to accept it as it is propounded to us, and to keep it as it is accepted by us, that we may obtain the ſeveral Bleſſings and Benefits promiſed in it to thoſe who firſt accept it, and afterwards keep it: It is true, the Lord promiſeth to enable his own people both to enter into Covenant, and alſo to abide in the Covenant and keep it to the end, but that no wiſe hinders his obliging them by the Covenant both to enter firſt into it, and after that to abide in it and keep it. This being premiſed, I prove that the Goſpel-Covenant is not without all Precepts, it is not ſuch a Doctrine of Grace as requires nothing of us at all, but it is a Doctrine of Grace that obliges us to do ſomething whereby we enter into Covenant, and to do yet more for the due keeping of Covenant with God. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I prove by the Teſtimony of God in the Scriptures of Truth,
<note place="margin">Firſt Proof from Divine Teſtimony.</note> that the Goſpel or New Covenant requires ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us, not indeed that we may be juſtified and glorified for the ſake of thoſe Duties; but in order to other Goſpel ends and purpoſes. I begin with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. in which Chapter we have an account of Gods renewing the Goſpel Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and inſtituting Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to be a Sign and Seal to confirm it to him and his Seed after him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was in Covenant with God before this time, therefore God did but now renew it with, and ratifie and confirm it to him; and the words which he uſed in the doing of this, are remarkable. I will cite the moſt material of them. And firſt in <hi>ver.</hi> the 7th, we have the words which contain and expreſs the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel-Covenant on Gods part: <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> This is the promiſſory part of the Covenant, that the Lord would be a God unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed. There is much in this; it comprehends all Gods part of the Covenant, that is, all that he undertook to be unto, and to do for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed. Secondly, in the 1, 9, 10. verſes, we have the words which contain and expreſs the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel Covenant on the part of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was already before this time in Covenant with God, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>I am God almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect, upright or ſincere.</hi> Here Faith is implyed, and ſincere Obedience expreſſed. Then again, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>God ſaid unto Abraham, Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me, and you, and thy ſeed after thee; Every man child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> The meaning of the words, <hi>This is my Covenant,</hi> is, This is the <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>token</hi> of my Covenant which ye ſhall keep, <hi>Every man child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> This appears to be ſo, from the following 11th verſe, where Circumciſion is expreſly ſaid to be a <hi>token</hi> of the Covenant. Circumciſion then is here ſaid to be the Covenant by a Sacramental Form of Speech, becauſe it was a token or ſign of the Covenant. The act of circumciſing, and ſubmitting to be circumciſed, was indeed a part of the duty and condition of the Covenant, but the Circumciſion when it was done, or the permanent effect, was a token or ſign of the Covenant: So theſe three Verſes, the 1, 9, and 10. expreſs the Preceptive part of the Covenant, and ſhew what was thereby required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to wit, that he being already in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by Faith, ſhould walk before God, and be perfect or ſincere, that he ſhould keep Covenant with God, as his Seed alſo ſhould do after him; and that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93175:38"/>cumciſion being now inſtituted to be a token of the Covenant, he and his Seed ſhould be circumciſed. Now theſe things being ſo, let Conſcience (if we have any) ſay whether this Goſpel-Covenant was ſuch a Doctrine of Grace as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no Duty at all of <hi>Abraham;</hi> or rather, whether it was not a Doctrine of Grace which plainly required ſome Duty of him, even that he ſhould walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Almighty God and be perfect or ſincere, that he ſhould keep Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and receive Circumciſion as a ſign and token of it? But now let any Man tell me plainly how this Goſpel-Covenant could be either kept or broken (as in this Chapter it is ſaid it might be, if it was nothing but Gods abſolute Promiſe without any Precept; or a Doctrine of Grace which requireth nothing at all to be done by Man? And to ſhow that this Scripture is thus underſtood by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, ſee the <hi>Dutch Annotations</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. where you will find theſe formal expreſs words; <q>[As for thee, or concerning thy part of the Covenant, after that God had given and paſt his Promiſes, he <hi>requireth</hi> likewiſe his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>Duty,</hi> as the ſecond compleating part of the Covenant.]</q> See alſo to this purpoſe the <hi>Aſſemblies Annotations</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. where they have theſe following words; <q>[Yet this was but <hi>upon condition</hi> of the Peoples part of the Covenant, which is <hi>Faith and Obedience.</hi>]</q>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Pools Annotations</hi> on <hi>Gen</hi> 17.9. have theſe very words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <q>[The agreement is mutual; my part was expreſſed before, now follows thy part, and the <hi>condition</hi> to which my Promiſe and Bleſſing is annexed]</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Divine Teſtimony to prove that the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, requires ſome Daties of us, is <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. There we have an account how God made a Covenant with the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, after they had received the Law of the Ten Commandments from the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to them in terrible Majeſty on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and pronouncing it with audible voice in the preſence of Six Hundred Thouſand People. In that 24th of <hi>Exodus</hi> we read, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> had received from the Lord the other Laws, to wit, the Ceremonial and Judicial;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He wrote them in a Book: God himſelf with his own hand, by his own immediate power, wrote the Law of the Ten Commandments on Two Tables of Stone, but for the other Laws <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote them in a Book, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He builded an Altar and Twelve Pillars; the Altar ſeems to have been a ſymbol of God in Chriſt, as one party in the Covenant; and the Twelve Pillars repreſented the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the other party, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. ſo that here were the outward Signs and Symbols of a Covenant between God and the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) He ordered certain perſons (ſuppoſed to be the firſt-born) to offer Sacrifices unto the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) He divided the Blood of the ſacrificed Beaſts into two equal parts, and mixed it with a little Water, as appears from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. whereby Chriſt was fitly repreſented, who came by Water and Blood, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6. and then having put it in Baſons, he ſprinkled one half of it on the Altar, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. to ſignifie that God was appeaſed and atoned by this Blood of the Sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces, as it repreſented the Blood of Chriſt, or his Bloody Sacrifice, and alſo that Chriſt was to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitied with his own Blood, and conſecrated to the continual exerciſe of his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Prieſthood in the holy place above, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) He took the Book of the Covenant (in which were written the Duties of the Covenant, to wit, in the Words and Laws of God, mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) and read it in the audience of the people; whereunto they conſented, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93175:38"/>ſignifyed their conſent, by ſaying, <hi>All that the Lord hath ſaid will we do, and be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, ver.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Sixthly)</hi> He took the other half of the Blood, and ſprinkled it on the People (to ſignifie the Ratification of the Covenant on their parts. with the application of the Vertue of Chriſt's Blood to their Conſciences, and their obtaining Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Juſtification, Acceſs unto. and acceptance with God through it alone.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(Seventhly.)</hi> Whilſt he ſprinkled the Blood upon the People, he ſaid, <hi>Behold the Blood of the Covenant,</hi> (<hi>i e.</hi> whereby the Covenant is confirmed) <hi>which the Lord hath made with you,</hi> concerning all theſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>From the Premiſſes we learn Two things. (1.) That this was a Type and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Covenant of Grace Confirmed and Ratified by the Blood of Chriſt; It was a Type and Figure of the New Covenant in its Goſpel-Form of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; for this Covenant was Ratified and Confirmed by the Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, as Repreſentative and Typical of the Blood of Chriſt, and of the New Teſtament in his Blood. So the Apoſtle inſtructs us in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) That this Typical Figurative Covenant had Precepts which required Duties of God's <hi>People.</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> took the Book of the Covenant, and read the Precepts to the People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.7. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. And when they had heard there read, they anſwered and ſaid, <hi>All that the Lord hath ſaid will we do, and be Obedient, Exod.</hi> 24.7. <hi>Moſes</hi> as God's Miniſter, in God's Name told them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Precepts to them what God required of them by this Covenant; they on the other part by their Anſwer expreſſed their conſent, and promiſed to be Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. Whether they were all Spiritually ſincere or not, (and I think they were not) yet they were then <hi>Serious</hi> and <hi>Morally ſincere,</hi> and in ſo far as they were ſuch, they did nothing but what was their Duty in giving their foreſaid <hi>Conſent;</hi> and what <hi>Moſes</hi> acting as God's Miniſter who did not know their hearts approved of, and thereupon Ratified and Sealed the Covenant between God and them. Now hence I think we have a plain Proof that the New Covenant, the Covenant of Grace or Goſpel hath Precepts which require Duties. For if the Typical Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Covenant had Precepts and required Duties, then the New Covenant in its Goſpel-Form of Adminiſtration, which was Typifyed and Figured by it; hath likewiſe Precepts, and requires Duties: For a Covenant that hath Precepts and requires Duties, doth not at all ſeem proper to Typify and Figure, a Covenant that hath no Precept, and requires no Duty. If my R. B. venture to deny that the foreſaid Covenant at <hi>Horeb,</hi> did Typifie the New Covenant in its Goſpel Form of Adminiſtration; he will find that he hath the Apoſtle againſt him, and alſo that he hath our own Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Art.</hi> 5, 6. and the Reformed Divines generally againſt him: Even the <hi>Marrow of Modern Divinity,</hi> a Book ſo much commended by Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Caryl, &amp;c</hi> and ſo much eſteemed by his good Friends, will be againſt him, as he may ſee, if he turn to the 54, 55, 56 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pages of that Book.</p>
               <p>The Third Divine Teſtimony to prove that the Goſpel-Covenant or Law of Grace requires ſome Duties of us, is to be ſeen in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and 30. <hi>Chap.</hi> That the Covenant renewed with all <hi>Iſrael</hi> Old and Young, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. is really the Goſpel-Covenant, or Covenant of Grace in its Legal Form of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration appears from hence, that it's ſaid to be a Covenant which God made with them, that they ſhould be his People, and that he would be their God, as he had ſaid and ſworn unto <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> But it was the Goſpel-Covenant, or Covenant of Grace, that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and confirmed with an Oath, That he would be the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and that they ſhould
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93175:39"/>be his People.

               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotations go the ſame way, and very clearly aſſign the reaſon of its being ſaid that the Covenant was made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Land of <hi>Moab, beſide</hi> the Covenant made with them in <hi>Horeb;</hi> Their words are [<hi>It was indeed one and the ſame Covenant, but Renewed, Repeated and Publiſhed here in the Fields of</hi> Moab, <hi>unto many other Perſons, in another place, and in another manner, than at</hi> Mount Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb, <hi>or</hi> Sinai] And with theſe agree the Aſſemblies Annotations on the place.

                  <hi>Horeb</hi> was the <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> and that this, in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> was the Goſpel-Covenant of Grace. I am not indeed altogether of their mind for I have already ſhewed, that the Covenant in <hi>Exod</hi> 24. which was made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> at <hi>Horeb,</hi> was not the Original Covenant of Works, but the Goſpel Covenant of Grace in Type and Figure; But though they and I differ in that, yet we both agree in this, which is the main thing, and ſufficient for my purpoſe.

               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking ſtill of the ſame Covenant, he ſays one of the Promiſes of it is, That the <hi>Lord will circumciſe the Heart of his People,</hi> and the heart of their Seed to love the Lord their God with all their Heart and Soul, that they may live, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. But ſo it is, That the Promiſe of Heart Circumciſion is certainly a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpel Covenant of Grace. (3) <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking ſtill of the ſame matter, and at the ſame time he ſaith as it is written in <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14, <hi>This Commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven, that thou ſhould ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it. Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou may'ſt do it.</hi> By which words he plainly teaches us, That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Commandment of which he there writes, is neither impoſſible, nor hard to be underſtood; nor yet is it impoſſible nor hard to be kept and obſerved; but that through Grace circumciſing the heart to love God, it is both eaſie to be known, and alſo eaſie to be kept and obſerved. Now this cannot be truely ſaid of the Covenant of Works. For as Mr. <hi>Shepard</hi> of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> well obſerves <hi>[The Coudition of Works is impoſſible to be wrought in us by the Spirit]</hi> And let not any Man think this ſtrange and uncouth, to ſay,
<note place="margin">Theſes Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae. pag 95.</note> That the Spirit of Grace cannot <hi>now</hi> work in us the Condition of the firſt Covenant, the Covenant of Works; for the Condition and Duty of that Covenant was, That Man ſhould be without all Sin in Habit or Act, and that he ſhould be ſinleſly Holy in Heart and Life, and continue ſo to be. But that is <hi>now</hi> impoſſible, becauſe it implyes a Contradiction for any meer Man ſince <hi>Adam</hi> broke the firſt Covenant, and we in him, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways without all Sin in Habit or Act, and to be always Sinleſly Holy in Heart and Life: For all Men are already guilty of Sin, and the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were all Sinners, and had broken the Covenant of Works before <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke, and when he ſpoke the foreſaid words unto them. And it implyes a contradiction, that by any Power whatſoever, a thing which hath been already, ſhould be made not to have been at all; or that a thing which exiſts at preſent, ſhould not exiſt at preſent whil'ſt it doth exiſt. It will ſignifie nothing here to ſay, That yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can make us ſinleſly Holy <hi>de futuro,</hi> if he pleaſe; for though that be very true, (abſolutely ſpeaking, the Spirit can make a Man ſinleſly Holy in Heart and Life, for time to come; though he hath been a Sinner in times part; for that implyes no contradiction: And the Spirit of Grace hath <hi>de facto</hi> done the thing in and upon the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect in Heaven,) yet it is nothing to the purpoſe here, becauſe <hi>that is not the Condition and Duty of the Covenant of Works,</hi> that Man ſhould ſin no more for the future; but <hi>its Condition and Duty is that Man ſhould
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93175:40"/>never once ſin at all, either in time paſt, preſent, or to come.</hi> And aſſoon as he hath once ſinned, he hath <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſo broken that Covenant, that from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>it ceaſes to be unto him a Covenant of Life for ever;</hi> as we heard before out of <hi>Rutherford,</hi> becauſe it admits of no Repentance with a Promiſe of Pardon and Life. The Condition then and Duty of the Covenant of Works being now ſimply impoſſible to ſinful Men, it cannot be ſaid with any colour of Truth, that it is eaſie to be performed through Grace; it cannot be ſaid of the Covenant of Works, as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that thou may'ſt do it:</hi> The quite contrary is true with reſpect to the Firſt Covenant, the Covenant of Works, the performing of its Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>is ſo far off from ſinful Men,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, that it <hi>is impoſſible to be brought near unto them;</hi> till both ends of a real contradiction be made to meet in one; and the ſame thing be <hi>made to be and not to be at the ſame time, and in the ſame reſpect.</hi> And as it cannot be truely ſaid to be <hi>very nigh, ſo it cannot be truely ſaid to be in the Mouth and Heart of ſinful Men, that they may do it:</hi> That were to ſay, that it is in Mens Mouth and Heart to do that which implys a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and is impoſſible to be done. But on the other hand it may be truely ſaid of the Goſpel or New Covenant, and it's Duty and Condition that through Grace circumciſing the Heart to love God: <hi>The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou may'ſt do it.</hi> Thus the Bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood this Paſſage, and quoted the Senſe and Subſtance, and partly the very words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and applyed them unto, and affirmed them of the Goſpel-Covenant or Law of Grace, as diſtinct from, and oppoſite unto the Law and Covenant of Works; For in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. The Apoſtle firſt ſhews out of <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.5. in what Form of words <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribed the Law and Covenant of Works, and its Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teonſneſs; That the Man which doth thoſe things, <hi>ſhall live by them.</hi> Secondly, In <hi>vor.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c</hi> he doth himſelf out of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and explain the nature of the Goſpel Covenant, and its Righteouſneſs; He calls it <hi>the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> and ſhews how we obtain it by Chriſt's Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it for us, and giving it unto us; we receiving it by Faith, and ſhewing our Faith and Thankfulneſs for it, by confeſſing him who purchaſed it, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a ſteadfaſt cleaving to the Lord with purpoſe of heart againſt all temptations to the contrary.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons I do believe that the Covenant in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and 30. <hi>Chapter</hi> is not the Firſt Covenant or Law of Works; <hi>but the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace:</hi> And conſequently, that the Goſpel Covenant hath Precepts, and requires Duty. And this is no New Opinion of my inventing, but is the real Truth, as I have proved from the words of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and a Truth alſo, now commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Orthodox. I know that there are ſome Learned Men of a different Judgment; the <hi>Arminians</hi> are of that ſort, and particularly <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> as appears from his Paraphraſe and Obſervations on <hi>Rom</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 8. which Expoſition of his ſeems to be founded upon that Opinion of theirs, That the Covenant of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks there, or elſewhere in the Books of the Law, did not promiſe Eternal Life, but only a Temporal Proſperous Life in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to them who ſincerely indeavoured to keep the Laws given them by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.16, 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39.</note> which I think is contrary to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12. for the Life which the Apoſtle denyes to be poſſible to be obtained by the Law, becauſe all Men have broken it; ſeems to be of the ſame kind with that Life which he affirms to be obtained by Faith. But it is Spiritual and Eternal Life which is obtained by Faith; therefore it is Spiritual and Eternal Life likewiſe which he denyes to be obtainable by the Works of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93175:40"/>Law. And the reaſon why it was not ſo obtainable, was becauſe no Man did or could keep the Law, ſo as not to fall under its curſe, even ſuch a curſe as Chriſt redeems from, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and 13. compared. The Apoſtle ſayes <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>If there had been a law given, which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law.</hi> He doth not any where ſay, that the Law could not give Eternal Life, becauſe it had no promiſe of Eternal Life. But elſewhere, to wit in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. he aſſigns the true reaſon why the Law of Works could not give life, Eternal Life, <hi>even becauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it was weak through the fleſh.</hi> It was the Sin of Man that diſabled the Law of Works that it could not give that Eternal Life which after the Fall it promiſed only <hi>oeconomically;</hi> that is, it propoſed and ſet Eternal Life before Mens Eyes in a form of words which before the Fall was <hi>really promiſſory</hi> of Eternal Life upon a <hi>poſſible condition;</hi> but after the Fall did but ſerve to remind us what Man once was, and what he ſhould ſtill have been; what he might have done, and what he might have attained unto <hi>by doing;</hi> but that having broken that Covenant we are all lyable to Eternal Death, and can never obtain Eternal Life by it; and therefore that it behoves us to ſeek Eternal Life and Salvation by Chriſt only upon the terms of the Goſpel and New Law, or Covenant of Grace; as was more fully explained before.</p>
               <p>This only I briefly hint on the by. I hope the R. Brother, with whom I have to do, will not flee from me into the <hi>Arminian</hi> Camp, and from thence come out againſt me clad with their <hi>Golia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But let him do in that matter as beſt pleaſeth him, I am reſolved to abide where I am in the Camp of the Orthodox, and thence I oppoſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reaſons of <hi>Fr.

               <p>Of the ſame Judgment with <hi>Junius</hi> is the Learned Profeſſour of <hi>Saumur Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus de Brais,</hi> as appears by his Paraphraſe, and Notes at the end of his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, pag.</hi> 336, 337.</p>

And thus I have proved by a Third Divine Teſtimony, that the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, hath Precepts, and requires of us ſome Duty. I might alſo prove this, from the 19. and 119. <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> acknowledges to contain a Deſcription of the Goſpel, under the Name of the Law of the Lord. For if that be true, it is clear as the Light, that the Goſpel hath Precepts, and requires Duty.

               <p>A Fourth Divine Teſtimony for this Truth out of the Old Teſtament, we may find in <hi>Micah</hi> the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. even as it was Expounded by the late Reverend Mr. <hi>Danſon,</hi> who before he took his leave, taught my R — Brother that whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Leſſon which he hath learned exactly, that the Goſpel hath no Precepts, and that there <hi>are no ſins againſt the Goſpel.</hi> Conſider we then, what the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good, and what doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, but to do Juſtly and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And now let us hear what Mr. <hi>Danſon</hi> ſaith upon this.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Danſon</hi>'s <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme.</hi> p. 49.</note> His Words are theſe, <q>[Becauſe God deſigns to take away glorying in Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Faith in God through the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is called a walking humbly with God, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. That it does relate <hi>to the Law of Faith,</hi> and but only by conſequence, (if at all), not directly to the Law of Providence, or ſubmiſſion to afflictions, I am induced to believe upon theſe two grounds. (1.) Becauſe otherwiſe God returns no Anſwer (which he ſeems plainly to deſign) to the Query, what the Lord will be pleaſed with, or what ſatisfaction ſhall be given him for <hi>Iſraels</hi> Sin, which is the Sum of the Queſtions, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Will the Lord be pleaſed,</hi> &amp;c. But underſtanding it thus, there is a plain Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> I do not expect any Righteouſneſs of thy Gift, but of thy Acceptance, or thus, I ſhall not be pleaſed with any Righteouſneſs which thou bringeſt, unleſs it be what I have firſt beſtowed on thee by Faith. (2.) The Pride of Mans Heart, makes him as loath to accept of a Righteouſneſs freely offered him, as to accept of the Puniſhment of his Iniquity juſtly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. It makes him as loath to part with the Priviledges he had in the Old Covenant, as he that hath ſet up for himſelf ſometime, is to turn an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: And therefore it is as true an Act of Humility, to accept of Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as of Chaſtiſements for Sin.]</q> Thus he. In which words he plainly acknowledges and endeavours to prove that the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> preached not the Law of Works, but the Goſpel of Grace to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who deſired to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by what means they might obtain God's favour. And particularly this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93175:42"/>is the Voice of the Goſpel and Law of Faith, <hi>The Lord requires thee to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And ſurely that is a Precept requiring a Duty, if ever there was a Precept in the World. Now if one part of the Prophets anſwer, be the Goſpel of Grace; who that is afraid to wreſt God's word to his own deſtruction, dare ſay, the other part of it, is the Law of Works? Since the whole anſwer to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is ſhort, and both parts of it, pronounced with one breath. By what certain mark may we know which part is Law, and which is Goſpel, if both be not Goſpel? Nay, if one part of the Anſwer direct them to the Law of Works and Old Covenant of Works, that by complying with its Terms, they may find Grace and Favour with God; Doth not the Prophet ſeem to ſeduce them from the only righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

If the Prophets anſwer to their queſtion. What they ſhould do to be Reconciled unto God? Tell them, that they muſt comply with the Terms both of the Law of Works, and of the Goſpel of Grace: He doth in effect teach them to ſeek for Juſtification and Reconciliation both by the Old Legal, and by the New Goſpel-Covenant; that is, both by their own Righteouſneſs, and alſo by anothers Righteouſneſs, to wit, Chriſt's. And then who could well blame them, if they took his Advice, and followed his Direction which he gave them in the Name of the Lord? For avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this inconvenience, I for my part do think that if part, then the whole Anſwer of the Prophet, in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. was Goſpel, and that he did but tell them what the Lord required of them by the Goſpel-Covenant to be done on their part, that they might obtain Juſtification and Salvation; to wit, firſt, (though it be laſt mentioned) that by Faith they ſhould walk humbly with their God, for obtaining Juſtification and Reconcilation. (2.) That from a Principle of Faith they ſhould do juſtly, and love Mercy, that they might declare their Thankfulneſs to God for his Grace and Favour to them through Chriſt, and alſo that they might be fitted, qualified, and prepared to receive more Grace, even the Grace of Eternal Life and Salvation for the only Satisfactory Meritorious Righteouſneſs and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Thus I have proved by Divine Teſtimony out of the Old Teſtament. That the Goſpel-Covenant or Law of Grace in its old way of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration had Precepts belonging to it, and required Duty of the Confederate People of God. But it may be, ſome will ſay, That though that be true, yet the caſe is altered, and now the Goſpel-Covenant in its Evangelical form of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, hath not one Precept, and requires no Duty at all. My Anſwer is, (1.) That that cannot be; for though the Goſpel-Covenant hath changed and put off its accidental Form of Adminiſtration; yet it retains ſtill, and can never change its Eſſential Form, and that is, that it requires Faith in Chriſt in order to Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſincere Obedience to all God's Commandments (which are in force, and not Abrogated) in order to Glorification, and Conſummate Salvation (2) I Anſwer, That it's Clear as the Light from the New Teſtament, That the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace now at this day hath Precepts, and requires Duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which is the thing that I am next to prove by Divine Teſtimony taken out of the Scriptures of the New Teſtament. And I begin with <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29.30. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.
<note place="margin">Teſtimonies out the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     </note> Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls. For my Yoke eaſie, and my Burden is light.</hi> In which words there is not only
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93175:42"/>a Command that all Diſtreſſed Souls believe, and by Faith come unto Chriſt the Son, unto whom the Father hath delivered all things; and an Encouraging Promiſe of Reſt to all that come, to all that ſincerely believe in Chriſt. But (2.) There is a Command laid upon Believers, to take upon them Chriſt's Yoke, and to learn Meekneſs and Humility of him; and what elſe is the meaning of that, but that the Lord will have Believers to obey his Precepts and imitate his Example? By Chriſt's Yoke and Burden cannot be meant any thing, but what includes his Precepts and Commandments. Now Chriſt's Precepts which are called his Yoke and his Burden, cannot poſſibly be the Precepts of the Law and Covenant of Works as ſuch, that is, Precepts requiring Perpetual, Perſonal, Sinleſs Obedience, as the Indiſpenſable Means and Condition of Life and Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For (1.) Chriſt here ſpeaks not ſimply as God, but as the Son of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and as the Mediator between God and Men, the Mediator of the New Covenant; and as ſuch under that formal Conſideration, he lays upon no Man the Yoke and Burden of Perſonal, Perpetual, Sinleſs Obedience to the Precepts of the Old Law and Covenant of Works, as the indiſpenſably neceſſary Means and Condition of Life and Happyneſs. (2) The Yoke and Burden of Perſonal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually Sinleſs Obedience to the Law of Works as the Condition of Life, is ſo far from being Light and Eaſie, that ever ſince the Fall of Man, it hath been intollerably heavy and impoſſible to be born by any of the ordinary Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> by any <hi>meer</hi> Man. (3.) Chriſt here promiſes to all that come unto him, and take his Eaſie Yoke and Light Burden upon them, that he will give them Reſt, even Reſt to their Souls; which promiſe (<hi>amongſt other things which it ſingifies</hi>) doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs implyes, That he will give their Souls Reſt and Eaſe from the moſt heavy galling Yoke and inſupportable Burden of Perſonal and <hi>ever-ſinleſs</hi> Obedience to the Precepts of the Law of Works, <hi>as the Condition of Life.</hi> Chriſt here promiſes unto Believers Reſt and Eaſe from <hi>the Condemning Power, and Rigorous Exaction of the Law of Works;</hi> and therefore he ſpeaks not here of that Foederal Law and its Precepts, <hi>as ſuch;</hi> but of the Goſpel and its Precepts. His Eaſie Yoke and Light Burden, are the Precepts of the Goſpel-Covenant; that is, the Precepts of the Moral Law, as ſtript of their Old Covenant Legal Form, and taken into the Goſpel or New Covenant, and cloathed with its New Goſpel Form; the Precepts of the Moral Law thus <hi>Evangelized</hi> together with the few poſitive Inſtitutions and Ordinances of the Goſpel, are Chriſt's Yoke and Burden; and a light Burden and eaſie Yoke they certainly are to True Believers. and ſincere Lovers of the Lord Jeſus: They are ſo light and eaſie through Grace, that the Saints love them, and delight in them. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.35. make me to go in the Path of thy Commandments; for therein do I delight. And <hi>ver.</hi> 47. <hi>I will deligh: my ſelf in thy Commandments, which I have loved.</hi> The Goſpel then hath Precepts and Chriſt by the Goſpel-Covenant Commands Believers to take upon them his Eaſie Yoke and Light Burden, and to all that do ſo, he promiſes Reſt, even Reſt to their Souls. When <hi>Salvian</hi> of old had quoted this Text, he immediately ſubjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned theſe words.

And our laſt <hi>Engliſh Annotations</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Take my Yoke upon you,</hi> [<hi>Our Lord by this Precept lets us know, there can be no True Faith, without Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt. —And the reſt in the Text is not promiſed to either of them ſeverally, but to both joyntly</hi>]</p>
               <p>A Second Teſtimony to prove this, is that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if you do them.</hi> In which words Chriſt Preached not the Law of Works, but the Goſpel of Grace to his Diſciples: For the Promiſe of Happyneſs is not made to Believers and ſinful Mens doing the Law of Works, but to their Evangelical Obedience unto the Precepts of the Goſpel or New Covenant. For, (1.) Conſider Chriſt here ſpeaks to ſinful Men, though Believers. (2.) He requires of them, the doing of thoſe things which he had taught them by his own Example As Love, Humility, Mutual Serviceableneſs. For here is a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſe, and in every Conditional Promiſe of God to Men, there is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed a Precept to perform the Condition.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) He promiſes them Happineſs if they do theſe things, although they were not without all Sin; which ſhews plainly, that it is not a Legal, but a Goſpel Promiſe. It is a Goſpel-Promiſe implying a Precept that requires Duty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignifying the Lord's Will to give the Reward of happineſs to them who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty.</p>
               <p>The like Promiſe we have before in <hi>John</hi> 8.51. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, if a Man keep my ſaying, He ſhall never ſee Death.</hi> This is not a Legal Promiſe, like that of the Firſt Covenant of Works, Repeated <hi>Occonemocally</hi> after the fall, [<hi>If thou keep the Law, thou ſhalt live;</hi>] But it is a Goſpel Promiſe which being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, doth plainly imply a Precept requiring the Condition and Duty of keeping Chriſt's ſaying; upon which it is expreſly promiſed, that a Man ſhall never ſee Death, that is, ſhall never be puniſhed with Eternal Death. Indeed the Conditional Form of Words in which the Old Covenant of Works is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and propoſed to Sinful Men after the Fall, being <hi>Oeconomical</hi> in the Senſe before explained, it doth not imply a Precept of God intentionally obliging Men <hi>now</hi> to have no Sin at all, as the Duty and <hi>Condition</hi> of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; for they were Sinners already before that repetition of the form of the Old Covenant; and what hath been, implyes <hi>now</hi> a contradiction not to have been; and the Infinitely Wiſe, Juſt and Good God, never Commands any Man to do a thing which is impoſſible to be done by any power whatſoever, which is even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be done by the help of his Spirit and Grace. But the Conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93175:43"/>of our Saviour in <hi>John</hi> 8.51. is of another Nature; it is not merely oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical, but real and intentional, really requiring the condition, and obliging Men to keep his ſaying, and intentionally promiſing unto all who do or ſhall keep his ſaying, that they ſhall never ſee Death. This plainly appears from the double aſſeveration wherewith our Saviour ſpoke the foreſaid Promiſe, ſaying, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſaying, be ſhall never ſee doath.</hi> Whence I conclude that the Goſpel is not without all Precepts; for here is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Precept to keep Chriſts ſaying.</p>
               <p>A Third Tellimony we have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10. <q>That is the Word of Faith which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy Heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved; for with the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</q> Obſerve here,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That by the Word of Faith is meant the Goſpel; which according to the <hi>Dutch Annotations</hi> on the place, is ſo called, becauſe by it <hi>we are exhorted</hi> and brought to Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Obſerve that beſides Faith in the Heart, which is required unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Juſtification, there is here required Confeſſion with the Mouth as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the obtaining of conſummate Salvation. And by Confeſſion with the Mouth, is meant an outward Profeſſion of the inward Faith of the Heart, and living ſuirable to our holy Profeſſion. Hence Mr. <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o</hi> in the laſt <hi>Engliſh Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiens on Rom.</hi> 10.9. ſaith, [<hi>There are but theſe two things which the Goſpel princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally requires in order to our Salvation. The one is the Confeſſion of Chriſt with our Mouths, and that in ſpight of all Perſecution and Danger, to own him for our Lord, and for our Jeſus; and to declare that we are and will be ruled and ſaved by him, and by him only. The other is to believe in our Hearts that God hath raiſod him from the Dead</hi>] Whence I conclude again, that the Goſpel is not without all Precepts; for it hath beſides the Precept of believing on Chriſt with the Heart, another Principal Precept of confeſſing him with the Mouth, that is, of living ſuitably to our Faith</p>
               <p>A Fourth Teſtimony to prove that the Goſpel hath Precepts, we have in thoſe places of the New Teſtament, where ſome are commended for their obeying and being ſubject to the Goſpel; and others are blamed and threatned for their diſobeying the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) We find that ſome are commended for obeying the Goſpel and being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it. Thus the believing <hi>Romans</hi> are commended for obeying the Goſpel; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>God be thanked that ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. This form</hi> of Doctrine is the Goſpel, as the <hi>Dutch Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> on the place tells us, ſaying expreſly that the <hi>Goſpel is a Doctrine of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſineſs.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> gave God thanks for this, that the believing <hi>Romans</hi> had from the Heart obeyed it: Which they could never have done, if the Goſpel Doctrine had had no Precept requiring their Obedience. For (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Doctrine) Precept and Obedience are relative, one to another; ſo that take away the Precept of a Doctrine, and you take away the poſſibility of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Doctrine which hath no Precept. On the other hand, if we once grant that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, we muſt by conſequence grant alſo that the Doctrine of the Goſpel hath ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which requires that Obedience, otherwiſe it can be no Obedience to that Doctrine. Again in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. we read that the Saints glorified God for the believing <hi>Corinthians</hi> their profeſſed <hi>ſubjection</hi> unto the Goſpel of Chriſt. Now it is unconceivable how they could be ſubject to the Goſpel, if it had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93175:44"/>commanding Authority over their Conſciences. For Subjection is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto and preſuppoſes a ſuperiour commanding Authority in that whereunto there is Subjection. This common ſenſe teaches us. But ſo it is that the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were ſubject to the Goſpel; and therefore the Goſpel is not without all Precepts, but it had a preceptive commanding Authority over them, to which they were ſubject.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) We find that others are blamed and threatned for not obeying the Goſpel. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16. <hi>They have not all obeyed the goſpel.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. <hi>What ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel of God?</hi> And 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>The Lord ſhall take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But now according to the principle of the <hi>Flacian</hi> Sectaries, that the Goſpel hath no Precept, there could be no ſuch thing as diſobedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: For where there <hi>is no Goſpel Law or Precept,</hi> there can be <hi>no Tranſgreſſion againſt the Goſpel.</hi> This one of the Brethren who was for that way, plainly ſaw, and granting the conſequence, declared it to the World in Print,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Danſons Confer.</hi> p. 18.</note> that he and his Party <hi>knew no Sins againſt the Goſpel.</hi> And indeed if the Goſpel had no Precept, there could be no Sin againſt it. But the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> tell us expreſly, that there is ſuch a thing <hi>as not obeying the Goſpel;</hi> and that perſons who obey it not, ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed for <hi>their diſobedience.</hi> And if ſo, then ſurely their <hi>diſobeying</hi> the Goſpel <hi>is a Sin againſt the Goſpel;</hi> whence it follows by neceſſary conſequence that the Goſpel hath ſome Precept, which was to be demonſtrated. And if it be ſaid, that the Moral Law commands Obedience to the Goſpel; I anſwer, be it ſo, that is ſo far from weakening that it rather ſtrengthens the Argument: For if it command Obedience to the Goſpel, then it commands Obedience to the Precept of the Goſpel; for without the Goſpels having ſome Precept, there might indeed be Obedience to the Law in other things; but there could be no Obedience to the Goſpel at all, nor could there be Obedience to the Law in that matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon that falſe ſuppoſition, the Law ſhould command a Chimerical impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; which is abſurd to affirm of the Juſt Law of the infinitely Wiſe God. Therefore from the Moral Law, its obliging us to obey the Goſpel, it neceſſarily follows that the Goſpel hath ſome Precept to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Teſtimony we have in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. where it is written that, <hi>The grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all men, teaching us that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> In this Scripture we are to obſerve two things: (1.) What is meant by the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, and which hath appeared unto all Men, or which bringeth Salvation unto all Men, and hath appeared? And it is generally confeſſed to be objective Grace, or <hi>the doctrine of Grace,</hi> that is, <hi>the Goſpel.</hi> (2.) What is this Grace, this Doctrine of Grace, of Goſpel, ſaid to do? And that the expreſs words of the 12 <hi>verſe,</hi> tell us plainly to be this, that it teacheth us, <hi>That d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nying ungodlineſs and worldly lucts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World.</hi> Now if the Goſpel teach us, that <hi>we ſhould live</hi> ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, then it hath ſome Precept which makes it our Duty ſo to live: For to teach us that <hi>we ſhould</hi> live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, is plainly to lay an obligation on our Conſcience, and to make it our Duty ſo to live: eſpecially conſidering that this Goſpel is the Goſpel of God, and it is God who is infinitely ſuperiour to us, and hath a ſoveraign authority over us, who by the Goſpel teacheth us that <hi>we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly.</hi> Gods teaching us that <hi>we ſhould do</hi> a thing, certainly obliges to do it; and therefore Gods teaching <hi>us by the Goſpel, that we ſhould live</hi> ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93175:44"/>and godly, obliges us by the Goſpel ſo to live; and conſequently the Goſpel hath ſome <hi>Precept whereby</hi> God <hi>obligeth</hi> us to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World.</p>
               <p>Thus the Learned Divines who were Authorized by their Superiours in <hi>Holland</hi> to write the <hi>Dutch Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Bible,</hi> underſtood this Scripture, as appears from their <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The truth which is according to godlineſs,</hi> [<hi>That is, which is ſuch that it muſt not only be known, but alſo by exerciſing of true Godlineſs be put in practice, and which preſcribes and requires true Godlineſs, and ſtirs up and brings men thereunto.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6 3.] compared with <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation;</hi> that is, ſay they, [<hi>The Doctrine of the Grace of god ſhewn us by Chriſt, and contained in the Goſpel.</hi>] And then in their <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on the 12th Verſe, they tell us, [<hi>That the ſaid Doctrine of Grace inſtructeth us that we ſhould live ſoberly, in reſpect of our ſelves, and justly, in reſpect of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and godly in reſpect of God.</hi> And if any yet doubt whether thoſe Learned Annotators held that the Goſpel hath Precepts obliging us to Duty, let ſuch read their <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. where they expreſly mention <hi>the Command of Faith, as a Command of the Goſpel, contradiſtinguiſhed from the Commands of the Law.</hi> And again a little after, they ſay, <q>[If <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid this of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, much more may the ſame be ſaid of the <hi>Promiſes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel,</hi> which are not only eaſie to be underſtood, as the Law is, <hi>but alſo are eaſie to obſerve by the power of Gods Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.]</q> See alſo the laſt (called <hi>Pools</hi>) <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. where they tell us, <q>That <hi>by the Grace of God,</hi> which brings Salvation, is <hi>meant the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> and that where it cometh, <hi>it directs all Men their Duties in their ſeveral ſtations,</hi> and teaches us that we <hi>ſhould live</hi> with reſpect to our ſelves, in a juſt government of our Affections and Paſſions; and with reſpect to others, giving to every one their due; and with reſpect to God, piouſly diſcharging the Duties, and paying the homage we owe unto him, ſo long as we live in this World, where we have Temptations to the contrary.</q> Now if the Goſpel, as it is a Doctrine of Grace, direct us to our ſeveral Duties, and <hi>teach us</hi> that we <hi>ſhould live as</hi> aforeſaid, then undoubtedly it hath Precepts as well as Promiſes; for without ſome Precepts it cannot <hi>direct our Duties,</hi> and teach us that <hi>we ſhould live</hi> ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World. I hope the R. Brother, with whom I have to do, will not flee to the Popiſh diſtinction between Precepts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and then ſay, that the Goſpel teacheth us that <hi>we ſhould live,</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>not by Precept</hi> but by <hi>Counſel:</hi> For he hath himſelf ſtopt that paſſage into the Popiſh Camp, by what he hath publiſhed to the World in his Sermon on the Death of the Late Queen, where he thus writes; [<hi>The greatneſs of God gives Authority to his Counſel.

If a Friend advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us to what we apprehend may be an advantage, we chearfully receive and follow his Counſel; but the direction of a Superiour is a Command, and adds the obligation of Duty to the conſideration of our own benefit. God then who is the greateſt above all, may very well guide all by his Counſel; and it is not more a Duty than a Priviledge, to obſerve the meaſures of his conduct.</hi> Thus he. And by this he hath left no room for the diſtinction between the Lords Advioe and Counſel on the one hand, and his Precept and Command on the other. So that if the Lords Goſpel direct and teach us our Duty by Advice and Counſel, it doth it alſo by Precept and Command; ſince the Lords Advice and Counſel ought to be unto us a Precept and Command.</p>

               <p>The Sixth and laſt Teſtimony out of the New Teſtament, which I ſhall alledge to this purpoſe at preſent, is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7. where it is written, <q>[I ſaw another Angel fly in the midſt of Heaven having the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel</hi> to preach unto them who dwell on the Earth, —ſaying with a loud voice, fear God and give glory to him, —and worſhip him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of Waters.]</q> This Scripture I quoted in the <hi>Apology,</hi> on the Margent <hi>pag.</hi> 23. but the Anſwerer paſſed it over; but for all that it ſtands ſtill in the <hi>Bible,</hi> as a Witneſs againſt thoſe who ſay that the Goſpel hath no Precept: For it is evident from the words of the Text, that the Moral Law, the Firſt Commandment of it, and by conſequence the other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Moral Law are taken into the Goſpel, ſo as that ſincere Evangelical Obedience to them is made one Article of the Goſpel Covenant, or Law of Grace, with reſpect to the obtaining poſſeſſion of Salvation conſummate in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory: For the Firſt Commandment of the Moral Law, obliges us to fear God and give glory to him; and to worſhip him who made the World; if then this firſt Command be not taken into the Goſpel-Covenant, and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it made one Article thereof, none could preach the Everlaſting Goſpel to the Inhabitants of the Earth; by ſaying, <hi>Fear God and give glory to him, and worſhip him that made the heavens and the earth,</hi> &amp;c. But ſo it is that the Angel was repreſented in the Viſion to <hi>John,</hi> preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel, and ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Fear God, and give glory to him,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore that Command to <hi>fear God, and give glory to him,</hi> &amp;c. is taken into the Goſpel, ſo as that ſincere Obedience to it is made one Article of the Goſpel Covenant: And then the Goſpel is preached in part, by ſaying, <hi>Fear God, and give glory to him,</hi> &amp;c. This is the plain obvious ſenſe of the words, and they muſt be violently wreſted, to put another ſenſe upon them. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotators therefore faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gave the meaning of the words, when in their <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.7. they ſaid in theſe words, [<hi>This is the firſt part of the Goſpels voice, whereby the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Beaſt are warned and exhorted to honour, fear and ſerve God only in Chriſt.</hi>]</p>
               <p>I might cite many other paſſages out of the New Teſtament and Old too, to prove that the Goſpel hath Precepts, and requires Duty of us; but theſe are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: And I am perſwaded that every ſincere lover and ſeeker of Truth, will or may eaſily find by the Divine Teſtimonies aforeſaid, taken out of the New Teſtament, that the Goſpe-Covenant in its new and moſt Evangelical form of adminiſtration, is not a meer abſolute promiſe without any Precept, but that as it hath Promiſes ſo it hath Precepts belonging to it, which require Duties of us, and of all to whom it is preached. Thus having finiſhed my firſt Proof from Divine Teſtimony, I paſs to my ſecond Proof from Humane Teſtimony. And before I proceed any further, I deſire it may be remembered that I do not argue from Humane Teſtimony, to confirm and ſtrengthen my Argument from Divine Teſtimony, or to prove any other thing than matter of fact; to wit, that I and my Reverend Brethren are not Innovators, nor ſingular in our interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, and in our belief that according to the Scripture, the Goſpel hath Precepts which require Duty; ſince long before we were born, other Holy Men and Eminent Miniſters of Chriſt, and bright ſhining Lights in Chriſts Church, have interpreted the Scripture as to this matter, juſt as we do; and have believed according to Scripture, what we believe at this day, That the Goſpel hath Precepts, and doth oblige us to Duties. This being premiſed to prevent miſunderſtanding of us, I come to produce my Humane Witneſſes which I divide into two ranks or claſſes. The (1.) of Antient Doctors of the Church.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93175:45"/>The (2) of Modern Divines. And I begin with Antient Fathers and Doctors of the Church;

               <p>My firſt Witneſs is <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who in his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> calls the New Teſtament or Covenant, (as we Chriſtians have it in its laſt, and excellenteſt form of adminiſtration),

It is an illuſtrious or clear image and repreſentation. The Doctrine of the Law being ingrafted in o the Olivetree, that is into the Goſpel, it becomes milder: For ſo it is that then Obedience is begun, and pleaſeth God, when it is ingrafted into the Goſpel.</hi> Thus <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſhews by an elegant ſimilitude how the Moral Law is taken into the Goſpel-Covenant, whereby it is otherwiſe modified than it was, as it pertained to the firſt Covenant of Works, and comes under a new form and ſanction; by which means our Obedience to the Moral Law, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as pleaſing to God through Chriſt, if it be ſincere tho' it be imperfect.

                  <hi>[The Law of it ſelf knows nothing either of the merit, or efficacy of the Son of God, and of the benefits of the Holy Spirit, which by Chriſt is poured out into the hearts of Believers. Nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth it expreſly teach of the help by which, and of the way how good works are wrought in us. Moreover the Law doth always and immutably require perfect Obedience of all without diſcriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, regenerate and unregenerate, and [of it ſelf] immutably damns all that have not that perfect Obedience. But the Goſpel not only promiſeth us help, but as for the regenerate, with reſpect to them,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93175:49"/>it mitigates the ſeverity of the Law with this ſweet temper and moderation, that as the perſon is freely received into favour for Chriſts ſake, ſo the begun Obedience, though imperfect and polluted, yet is pleaſing to God in perſons reconciled through Faith, for the Mediators ſake. This Doctrine of the Goſpel, unleſs it be added to the Legal Precepts, which are both repeated, and preached, and alſo are brought under a ſanction, and confirmed, neceſſarily and immutably in Goſpel Sermons, the doctrine of good Works, will not only be lame and maimed, but it will alſo be unprofitable,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus <hi>Pezelius</hi> ſhews the difference between the Law Precepts as fortified with the ſanction of the firſt Law of Works, and the ſame Precepts as they are brought under a new ſanction, and have put on a new form in the Goſpel: In this laſt ſenſe the Precepts of the Moral Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the New Covenant, and are Precepts of the Goſpel. Yea the ſame <hi>Pezelius</hi> in the ſame Book hath demonſtrated at large againſt the <hi>Flacians,</hi> that over and beſide the Precepts of the Moral Law which are now Evangelized, the Goſpel hath ſome Precepts which are proper to it ſelf, and require Evangelical Faith and Repentance, which the Moral Law by it ſelf immediately doth not require at all. Some of his words are,
<note n="(z)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>At nihil cum hoc ſomnio commune habet, dicere in Evangelio mandatum peculiare eſſe, non patefactum in lege, viz. de ſide in Chriſtum, cum qua pugnat incredulitas in Filium Mediatorem,—In lege fidei, i.e. doctrinâ Evangelii non tantùm eſt promiſſio gratuita miſericordiae Dei, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Filium Mediatorem, ſed etiam mandatum, quod praecipit ut agnoſcamus Mediatorem, &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus illi promiſſioni.

This Precept in its whole kind differs from the Legal Precepts which preach of Moral Obedience. And as it would be Childiſh, from this, that the Law hath Promiſes, to infer that ſince the Law differs from the Goſpel, therefore there is no Promiſe to be aſſigned to the Goſpel; ſo it is great ſtupidity to argue thus: The Law hath Precepts, therefore no peculiar Precept is to be aſſigned unto the Goſpel, leſt a new Law, or an Evangelical Law, ſhould ſeem to be introduced,</hi> &amp;c.] See what follows there; eſpecially conſult what he writes in Pag. 100, 101, 102, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 126, 127, 128, 129, 135, 136, 149, 150, 151. And in Pag. 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, where he invincibly proves againſt <hi>Flacius,</hi> that the Goſpel hath Precepts; that beſides the Precepts, which in reſpect of the matter of them, are common both to the Law of Works and Goſpel of Grace, there are Precepts which <hi>by themſelves immdiately require Evangelical Faith and Repentance,</hi> and that theſe Precepts are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> to the Goſpel. Thus we ſee, that the Opinion which is lately brought in amongſt us, that the Goſpel hath no Precepts which require Duty, and that there are no Sins againſt the Goſpel, is nothing but the old Errour of <hi>Flacius</hi> and his Party, which they broached in oppoſition to the Learned, Pious and Prudent <hi>Melancthon;</hi> and which was confuted and exploded by the Reformed above an hundred years ago.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Shephard's Theſes Sabbaticae Theſ. 110. pag. 78. edit. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1649.</note> 
                  <q>[The Goſpel under which believers now are, requires no doing (ſay they), for doing is proper to the Law, the Law promiſeth life, and requireth conditions, but the Goſpel <hi>(ſay they)</hi> promiſeth to work the condition, but requires none; and therefore a believer is now whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from all Law.</q> 
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi>) <hi>the Goſpel and Law are taken two ways.</hi> (1.) <hi>Largely, the Law for the whole Doctrine contained in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Goſpel for the whole Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles contained in the New Teſtament.</hi> (2.) <hi>Strictly, the Law</hi> pro lege Operum (<hi>as</hi> Chamier <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth</hi>), <hi>and the Goſpel</hi> pro lege fidei. i.e. <hi>For the Law of Faith: The Law of works ſtrictly taken is that Law which reveals the Favour of God, and Eternal Life, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of doing, or of perfect Obedience. The Law of Faith ſtrictly taken, is that Doctrine which reveals remiſſion of ſins, and reconciliation with God by Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs only apprehended by Faith. Now the Goſpel in this latter Senſe, excludes all works, and requires no doing in point of Justification and Remiſſion of ſins before God, but only believing: But take the Goſpel largely, for the whole Doctrine of Gods Love and Free Grace, and ſo the Goſpel requires doing; for as it is an Act of God's free Grace to juſtifie a man without calling for any works thereunto, ſo it is an Act of the ſame free grace, to require works of a perſon juſtified, and that ſuch poor ſinners ſhould stand before the Son of God on his Throne, to miniſter unto him, and ſerve him in righteouſneſs and holineſs all the days of our lives,</hi> Tit. 2:14. <hi>And for any to think that the Goſpel requires no conditions, is a ſudden Dream againſt hundreds of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which contain conditional yet Evangelical Promiſes, and againſt the Judgment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93175:50"/>of the moſt Judicious of our Divines,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus Mr. <hi>Shephard;</hi> where it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, (1.) That according to him, the Goſpel even ſtrictly taken, as it reſpects Juſtification only, requires the Duty and Condition of believing. And therein I agree with him, that it requires Faith, and <hi>only</hi> Faith, as that whereby we <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; for to do that, is the Office of Faith alone, and of no other Grace or Duty. (2.) It is obſervable, that according to him, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel taken largely (not for all the books of the New Teſtament, but) for the whole Doctrine <hi>of God's Love and free Grace,</hi> ſo it requires doing of Juſtified Perſons, and it requires not only the Duty of believing, but it alſo requires that we ſerve God in righteouſneſs and holineſs all the days of our lives. This is plain, and ſo plain, that I hope no honeſt man, who fears God, and loves truth, will ever dare to deny it: For my own part, I muſt profeſs to the world, that I am perſwaded it is my Duty to loſe my life, rather than impudently deny ſo plain a matter of Fact. (3.) It is to be obſerved, that tho Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> do not here mention <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> in order to <hi>remiſſion of ſins,</hi> yet afterwards in p. 94. of the ſame book, he doth expreſly mention it, as well as Faith, tho it have not the <hi>ſame uſe and office</hi> which Faith hath in Juſtification. His words are, [<hi>Is not this preaching of the Goſpel the iuſtrument and means of working that Faith in us, which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us in the Goſpel? And muſt not Jeſus Chriſt uſe the means for the end? were not thoſe</hi> 3000 <hi>brought unto Chrïſt by Faith, by</hi> Peter<hi>'s promiſe of remiſſion of ſins,</hi> upon, their Repentance? <hi>Were not many filled with the Holy-Ghoſt when they heard this Goſpel thus preached upon condition of believing?</hi> Acts 10.43, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This was written againſt one <hi>W.C.</hi> Whether the Spirit of that perſon hath poſſeſſed any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in our day, I will not ſay, let them who are concerned look to that. This Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Shephard,</hi> I conclude with what he ſays in p. 79. [<hi>As do and live hath been accounted good Law, or the Covenant of Works, ſo believe and live, hath been in former times accounted good Goſpel, or the Covenant of Grace, until now, of late, this wild Age hath found out new Goſpels that</hi> Paul <hi>and the Apoſtles did never dream of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now obſerve here, that in this <hi>[believe and live]</hi> which Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> ſays in former times uſed to be accounted good Goſpel, there is, (1.) A Precept, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;</hi> for it is a Verb of the <hi>Imperative Mood,</hi> which commands and requires the Duty of believing. (2.) There is a Promiſe to thoſe who obey the Precept and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty through Grace, That <hi>through Christ they ſhall live.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> will have the Goſpel to be an Abſolute Promiſe, <hi>without any Precept at all.</hi> Therefore this is no good Goſpel in his Account. Whether then he be one of thoſe who have found a New Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles did never dteam of, let him look to that. I hope, if he ſee his miſtake, he will rectiſie it. <hi>Nullus pudor ad meliora tranſire.</hi>

               <p>Again, ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 191. <hi>This I grant (which I deſire the Reader carefully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) the Law and the Covenant of Grace do not one and the ſame way Command Faith, and forbid unbelief. I ſpeak now of the Covenant of Works, and of the Covenant of Grace, as they are two Covenants ſpecifically and formally different.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again he puts the Queſtion. ib. p. 192. 103. <hi>Whether doth the Lord Mediator, as Mediator, command the ſame good Works in the Covenant of Grace, which are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Covenant of Works?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then Anſwers, <hi>According to tht matter of the thing Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> quoad rem mandatam, <hi>He Commands the ſame, and charges upon all and every one the Moral Duty, even as Mediator; but ſimply they are not the ſame,</hi> Quoad modum mandandi. <hi>It ſhall not be needful to diſpute whether they be Commands differing in Nature; for not only doth the Mediator Command Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon his interpoſed Authority as Law-giver, and Creator, but alſo as Lord Redeemer upon the Motive of Goſpel-Conſtraining-Love; in which notion he calls Love the keeping of his Commandments (if they Love him,</hi> John 14.) <hi>the New Commandment of Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, ib. p. 198, 199. he ſays, <hi>The Obedience of Faith, or Goſpel-Obedience hath leſs of the Nature of Obedience, than that of</hi> Adam, <hi>or of the Elect Angels, or that of Chriſt. It's true, we are called Obedient Children, and they are called the Commandments of Christ, and Christ hath taken the Moral Law, and made uſe of it in an Evangelick way; yet we are more (as it were) patients <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel-Commands, not that we are meer patients, as Libertines Teach, for Grace makes us Willing; but we have both Supernatural Habits, and influence of Grace Furniſhed to us from the Grace of Chriſt, who hath Merited both to us, and ſo in Goſpel Obedience, we offer more of the Lords own, and leſs of our own, becauſe he both Commands, and gives us grace to Obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all this and more that I could quote out of Mr. <hi>Rutherford's</hi> Writings, it's manifeſt that he believed as we do, that the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace hath Precepts, and requires Duty, and that it is not a meer abſolute promiſe that requires no duty or us at all.</p>
               <p>My 10th Witneſs is the late Reverend and Learned Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> whoſe memory I honour, tho it be ſaid that I beſtowed ſome Diſadvantageous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon him; but it is not true, for to tell the World that he retracted what he had before confidently Written, when it pleaſed the Lord to give him further Light, as he apprehended; is ſo far from being to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that it is on the contrary very much for his Honour; and plainly ſhews that tho he was a fallible man (as we all are) yet he was in that, an humble Man, and a ſincere lover of Truth: And I wiſh Mr. G. may follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, for aſſuredly it will be more for his Reputation and Honour, than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately to perſiſt in the <hi>Flacian</hi> Error, which ſome (it ſeems) have drawn him into.

And afterwards in the ſame book, chap. 33. p. 652. the Doctor ſays, [N. 3. <hi>Nor doth</hi> Biddle <hi>inform us what he intends by</hi> keeping the Commands of God, <hi>Whether an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, perfect, and every way</hi> compleat keeping of them <hi>up to the higheſt Degree of all things, in all things; circumſtances and concernments of them: Or whether the keeping of them in an univerſal ſincerity, accepted</hi> before God, <hi>according to the</hi> Tenour of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>be intended.</hi> Ner, 4. <hi>What</hi> Commandments <hi>they are which he chiefly reſpects, and under what</hi> conſideration; <hi>Whether</hi> all the Commandments of the Law of God, <hi>as ſuch; Or whether the</hi> Goſpel-Gommands of Faith and Love, <hi>which the places</hi> (1 John 5.3. <hi>and</hi> Mat. 11.30.) <hi>from whence he anſwers, do reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the following page Doctorr <hi>Owen</hi>'s 5th Anſwer is, [<hi>That to keep the Commandments of God, not as the Tenour of the</hi> Covenant of Works <hi>nor in an abſolute perfection of Obedience and Correſpondency to the Law, but ſincerely and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93175:52"/>uprightly unto acceptation, according to the Tenour</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, and the Obedience it requires, through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit and Grace of God, <hi>is not only a thing</hi> poſſible, <hi>but eaſy, pleaſant and delightful. Thus we ſay, That a perſon regenerate, by the aſſiſtance</hi> of the Spirit and Grace of God, <hi>may keep the</hi> Commandments of God, <hi>in yielding to him in anſwer to them, that ſincere Obedience which in Jeſus Chriſt, according</hi> to the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace <hi>is required: Yea, it is to him an eaſy and pleaſant thing ſo to do.</hi> This is ſufficient to ſhow that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> was far from thinking that the Goſpel Covenant hath no precepts, but is a meer abſolute promiſe or Doctrine of Grace that requires nothing of us at all. He ſays, the quite contrary as appears by his words, to wit that it hath precepts, as well as promiſes, and that it requires of us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, in order to our obtaining poſſeſſion of Eternal ſalvation in Heavenly Glory. I could bring many more, very many worthy and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, Modern Divines, to bear Teſtimony to the point under conſideration, that the Goſpel hath precepts and requires Duties, but theſe are enough; at preſent therefore I ſhall forbear mentioning any more, except the late Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Ingenious Mr. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> who in his ſhort diſcourſe concerning the guilt of ſin, and pardon of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond page grants expreſly that there are both Goſpel-precepts, and Goſpel-ſins, and tells us. (1.) That <hi>Goſpel precepts, are mainly the ſame for ſubſtance with thoſe of the Law, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting their obſervance with the ſame Rigour, Namely for Juſtification.</hi> And I add, nor yet for ſalvation. (2.) <hi>That Goſpel-ſins are the Tranſgreſſion of ſuch Goſpel-precepts.</hi> Thus I have proved both by many clear Teſtimonies of God, and alſo of good Men Ancient and Modern, that the Goſpel-Covenant is not without all precepts, it is not ſuch a Doctrine of grace, as requires nothing of us at all; but it is a Doctrine of Grace that obliges us to Duty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us ſincere obedience to its Evangelical precepts, in an Evangelical way, for our due keeping of Covenant with God in Chriſt, and in order to our obtaining the Conſummate Life and happineſs through Chriſt promiſed in the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now from the foreſaid Conſiderations, and Teſtimonies of God and good Men, it will not be difficult to gather a ſhort and clear anſwer to my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brother's Reaſons and Arguments which he brings to prove that the Goſpel is ſuch a Doctrine of Grace as hath no precepts, and requires no duty at all.</p>

               <p>And firſt he argues from the nature and uſe of precepts. They are <hi>deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (ſays he) pag. 42. <hi>As the Rule of our Actions, they inſtruct us what to do; they draw the lines of our Duty, and ſet the limits of our obedience. But all this is the proper office of the Moral Law, which it compleatly diſcharges, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any aſiſtance.</hi> I Anſwer. (1.) It is not true, that the Moral natural Law without the aſſiſtance of any poſitive Law, doth <hi>by it ſelf immediately</hi> inſtruct us in, and oblige us to all the particulars of our Duty. For as at the firſt Creation when the Moral natural Law, was perfectly and clearly written in Man's heart, it did not by it ſelf immediately in the firſt inſtant after his Creation, oblige him not to eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, till God had given him <hi>another</hi> poſitive <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Precept</hi> not to Eat of it, and then by means of the poſitive Law, the Moral natural Law obliged him not to eat of it; So now the ſame Moral Law would never by it ſelf immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige us to ſeveral duties, if there were not a poſitive Law and Precept
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93175:52"/>of Chriſt which did firſt make them to be duties, and oblige us to the doing of them. Of this ſort is Baptiſm with water in the Name of Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt. The Moral, Natural Law would never <hi>by it ſelf immediately</hi> oblige men to be ſo Baptized, if the Lord Chriſt, as King and Head of his Church, had not by a new Act of his Royal Authority made a poſitive Law, and given a poſitive Precept, obliging men to be baptized as aforeſaid; which being done, the moral natural Law doth alſo oblige us to be baptized, but it is <hi>only mediately,</hi> and <hi>by conſequence.</hi> It is <hi>mediante lege poſitiva, ſed non perſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate.</hi> So it is the Goſpel-Law, or Covenant of Grace, which <hi>by it ſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> obliges us to Juſtifying Faith and Evangelical Repentance in the Senſe before-mentioned and proved; and then the moral natural Law does alſo medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and by neceſſary conſequence oblige us to the ſame Duties.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I anſwer, That ſince the making of the Goſpel-Covenant with fallen man, the moral natural Law hath ſo belonged to it, that the requiring ſincere Obedience to the moral Law, hath been one Article of the Goſpel-Covenant. The ſaid moral Law then not only as ſeparated from the Goſpel covenant, but even as included in it, (in the ſenſe before explained) doth inſtruct us what to do, draw the Lines of our Duty, and ſet the limits of our Obedience upon Goſpel-grounds, and to Goſpel-ends and purpoſes, as hath been fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by Teſtimonies of God and Men. See <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.— If he now Object and ſay that this proves that the Precepts are no parts of the Goſpel, but borrowed from the Law. I anſwer, It proves no ſuch thing; and what he talks of borrowing Precepts from the Law, is falſe and unintelligible; For I demand, who it is that borrows Precepts from the Law? Either it muſt be the Goſpel, or God: But it can be neither. And (1.) It is not the Goſpel that borrows Precepts from the Law, for borrowing is a Perſonal Act, but the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is no Perſon, therefore it cannot Borrow. Again, the Goſpel, according to this Brother, is nothing but an Abſolute Promiſe, or bundle of Abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; let him then prove, if he can, that an abſolute Promiſe borrows a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; and ſhew how it doth ſo borrow; for we neither do, nor can believe it upon his bare word. (2.) It is not God who borrows Precepts from the Law. For (1.) He that borrows a thing, <hi>doth want and need that thing,</hi> before he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it, and he borrows it to ſupply his want. But God never <hi>wanted and needed the precepts of the Law.</hi> (2.) (The thing which one <hi>borrows,</hi> is not <hi>his own</hi> before he borrows it, but belongs to another Perſon; but the Law and its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <hi>were always Gods own,</hi> and therefore he could never borrow the Precepts of the Law from another, to whom they belonged. The Truth is, God is the Author and Owner both of the Law, and of the Goſpel; and he firſt made the Law, and Subjected man unto it, and obliged him to keep it perfectly; but Man having tranſgreſſed it, God made the Goſpel-Covenant, and propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to Man, and therein offered him a Remedy againſt the Sin and Miſery he had brought on himſelf and his Poſterity, by the breach of the Law: He commanded Man alſo, by Faith, to accept of the Remedy offered in the Goſpel-Covenant, and for the future, to perform ſincere obedience to the Law which he had formerly Tranſgreſſed. Here is no borrowing Precepts from the Law, but after the Law was broken, and thereby Man Ruined, God of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Free-grace ſo made, and Propoſed to Man the Goſpel-covenant (or which is the ſame, the New Law of Grace) as thereby, (1.) To oblige him to believe in Chriſt, and by Faith to receive the Remedy offered: And (2.) For the future to give ſincere Obedience to the Moral Law, in order to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining full poſſeſſion of the Happineſs purchaſed by Chriſt the Mediator, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93175:53"/>promiſed in the Goſpel-covenant, whereof Chriſt is Mediator. And thus it was that the Moral Law came to belong to the Goſpel, not by the Goſpel's, nor by God's <hi>borrowing</hi> the precepts of the Law (which to imagine is Ridiculous) but by God's making ſincere obedience to his own Moral Law, to be one of the Terms of his Goſpel Covenant; and by his ſo framing the Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as by it to require of Man, ſincere obedience to the Moral Law. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect, upright or ſincere. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. The Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared unto all Men; teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godlily in this preſent world: Looking for that bleſſed hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Secondly, my <hi>R. B.</hi> indeavours to prove that the Goſpel can have no precepts, becauſe if it had any precepts, God would not be infinitely wiſe and unchangeable, and his Moral natural Law, which he firſt gave to Man at his Creation would not be perfect. This Conſequence he labours to prove in pag. 43. And I freely grant that the Goſpel could have no precepts, if from its having precepts, it did follow by good and neceſſary Conſequence that God would not (on that ſuppoſition) be infinitely wiſe and abſolutely unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that his Moral natural Law would not be perfect. For certainly God is infinitely wiſe and abſolutely unchangeable, this is as ſure and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as it is that there is a God at all. It is certain alſo, and I have always believed it, and here before aſſerted it, that the Moral natural Law is moſt <hi>perfect in its kind,</hi> and obliges to the moſt perfect, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſinleſsly perfect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſeveral duties which belong to it, <hi>In that way which the Lord God intended,</hi> It ſhould oblige to the performance of them. If my <hi>R. B.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this as firmly as I do, then we are agreed as to this matter of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom, and unchangeableneſs of God, and the perfection of his Moral natural Law <hi>in its kind.</hi> But tho we be agreed in this, yet we do differ, and ſhall differ about the Conſequence; for I do utterly deny that it follows by any good and neceſſary Conſequence, that God would not be infinitely wiſe and unchangeable, and his Moral Law perfect in its kind; if the Goſpel have any precepts, and if God have ever given to Man any new poſitive Law, ſince he firſt created him with the Moral natural Law written in his heart. And it is not without good reaſon, that I deny Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Conſequence as utterly falſe and blaſphemous. For (1) according to his own Principle, Gods making unto Man a new promiſe, doth not impeach his infinite wiſdom and abſolute unchangeableneſs; for in pag. 49. He ſaith, that <hi>Repentance is a duty to which Man was tyed before any New Covenant of Grace was made; and before God had revealed any thoughts of favour to him, or any purpoſes of grace in that firſt promiſe of the Seed of the Woman, breaking the Serpents head.</hi> In theſe words he plainly acknowledges that <hi>when</hi> God firſt created Man, and gave him the Moral Law, he had not <hi>then</hi> made him any promiſe of Goſpel grace and mercy; but the firſt promiſe <hi>of that nature,</hi> was made to Man after the fall: And yet I do not think that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> dare ſay, that Gods mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>New promiſe</hi> to Man, did impeach his wiſdom as defective, or infer any change in his nature or will. And if a new promiſe did not, then I ſay that no more did a new precept impeach Gods wiſdom as defective, or infer any change in his nature or will. For there is nothing can be ſaid againſt a new precept as inconſiſtent with the infinity of Gods wiſdom, and his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, but the like may be ſaid againſt a new promiſe: And if I durſt give my ſelf leave to prat boldly and blaſphemouſly againſt a new Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93175:53"/>I have no more to do but to take what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſays againſt a New Goſpel Precept, and with the varying of a few words, apply it to a New Goſpel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and I thereby prove, That it's not conſiſtent with the Wiſdom and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of God, to make a New Goſpel-Promiſe, juſt as he proves, That it is inconſiſtent with his Wiſdom and Unchangeableneſs to give a New Goſpel-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. For my part, I dare not imitate Mr. <hi>G.</hi> in his way of Reaſoning here; but there want not Infidels, too many, who by his way of diſproving a New Goſpel Precept, will endeavour to diſprove a New Goſpel-Promiſe, and will not ſtick to ſay, after the Example of my <hi>R. B.</hi> That for God to make a New Goſpel-Promiſe, after the firſt Legal Covenant of Works, and the Legal Promiſe implied in it, would argue, That his <hi>Wiſdom was deficient, as not knowing at firſt all that was good for man, and neceſſary to be promiſed to him, and believed by him,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) God gave a new precept to Man before the fall, which was really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Moral natural Law. For inſtance, the Command not to eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 2.17. was ſuch a precept. This is ſo clear that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has in effect confeſſed it, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. For there he ſaith that the <hi>Moral natural Law regarded the Act of eating the fatal Fruit, as a thing indifferent;</hi> and that <hi>indeed it was a thing indifferent, before the prohibition;</hi> To wit, by the new precept which came after the Moral natural Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be really diſtinct from it. There he confeſſes, (1.) That the Moral natural Law did not at firſt, and by it ſelf immediately forbid the Act of eating the foreſaid Fruit. (2.) That therefore it remained ſtill a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to eat, or not to eat of that Fruit, till the new precept was given. (3.) That it was the new precept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Which <hi>firſt, by it ſelf, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately prohibited the eating of it,</hi> and obliged Man not to eat it; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, it would have ſtill remainded indifferent, notwithſtanding any thing that the Moral natural Law did or could ſay. Now if before the fall, God gave Man a <hi>new poſitive precept,</hi> which <hi>first obliged</hi> him to a certain duty, and forbad the Commiſſion of the contrary ſin; and if this <hi>new</hi> poſitive precept, requiring duty and forbidding Sin, was <hi>then</hi> very well <hi>conſiſtent</hi> both with the wiſdom and unchangeableneſs of God, and alſo with the perfection of his Moral natural Law; tho it and the Moral natural Law were two things real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct: I ſay, if it was ſo <hi>then</hi> before the fall, I put my <hi>R.</hi> Brother to prove that <hi>after the fall,</hi> it was inconſiſtent with Gods infinite wiſdom and immutability, and with the perfection of his moral Law, to give unto man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>New Goſpel-Precept,</hi> which ſhould oblige him to Duty, whereunto the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral natural Law did not, <hi>by it ſelf immediately oblige him before.</hi> If Mr. <hi>G.</hi> continue to affirm this, he muſt prove it; for I utterly deny that God's giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new Goſpel Precept, is inconſiſtent with his VViſdom and Immutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with the perfection of his Moral natural Law: and I am perſwaded that he can never prove that inconſiſtency, no more then he can prove it inconſiſtent with Gods wiſdom and immutability and with his Moral Laws perfection, to give unto <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, the new poſitive Precept of not Eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledg, after he had written the ſaid Moral Natural Law in his heart, at his firſt Creation. If he ſay, as in effect he doth, <hi>That the moral natural Law obliged</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>not to eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, becauſe it commanded him to obey God in whatever he ſhould require.</hi> And ſo God's requiring <hi>Adam</hi> by a New poſitive Precept, to <hi>abſtain from eating the ſaid Fruit,</hi> is well conſiſtent with his wiſdom, and with his moral Laws Perfection. I anſwer, That my <hi>R. B.</hi> may ſee, if he will open his Eyes, that this makes againſt him, and for me. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) He muſt, and he doth grant, That the abſtaining from eating of that Fruit, was <hi>firſt required by a new poſitive Precept,</hi> in Order of Nature, <hi>before</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93175:54"/>the moral natural Law commanded any ſuch Abſtinence; ſo that it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſaid Abſtinence only <hi>mediately,</hi> and <hi>by conſequence,</hi> after that it was <hi>firſt immediately</hi> commanded by the <hi>New poſitive Precept, ſuperadded to the Law of Nature.</hi> (2.) He knows well enough, that it is our profeſſed belief that <hi>in like manner,</hi> tho the Moral Natural Law, the general Law of our Creation, doth Command us to obey God in whatever he requires of us by any new Special Goſpel Precept; yet doth God <hi>firſt in order of Nature require</hi> our obedience to the Goſpel by the <hi>New Goſpel-Precept immediately;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> by means of that ſpecial new Goſpel-Precept, the general Law of our Creation comes to take hold of our Conſcience with reſpect thereunto, and obliges us to obey God therein: So that here are two Precepts that oblige us to the ſame thing, but in <hi>different ways:</hi> Firſt, There is the ſpecial <hi>New-Goſpel-Precept,</hi> which <hi>by it ſelf, immediately</hi> obliges us to ſuch a ſpecial Act of Goſpel Obedience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is the <hi>general old Law of our Creation,</hi> or the Natural Precept which obliges us to yeild obedience unto the ſpecial New Goſpel-Precept; and ſo it is with reſpect to all the new poſitive Laws which ever God gave unto his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either under the Old or New Teſtament. The Law of nature did not, and could not enact thoſe new Laws for the Church; But after that God had once enacted them by a new Exertion of his Legiſlative Authority, then the natural Law, the general Law of Creation, obliged the Church and People of God to the Obſervance of thoſe new and ſpecial poſitive Laws. (3.) The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I deny, that the giving of new poſitive Goſpel-Precepts unto man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt giving of the natural Law to him, doth any way impeach the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom and immutability of God; It is, becauſe it was not for want of foreſight of what man would afterwards need, and what his ſad Circumſtances would require, that ever God gave him <hi>any new Goſpel-Precept</hi> (or Promiſe,) as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> would inſinuate: But on the contrary, it was, becauſe God by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom did foreſee that Man would after the fall want, and his ſad Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would need both new Goſpel promiſes and precepts; and becauſe he had unchangeably purpoſed from Eternity to give him after the fall, ſuch Goſpel promiſes and precepts, as would be ſuitable to his ſad Circumſtances, and through the Grace of the Holy Spirit, would be an excellent uſeful means to recover him out of that ſad ſtate of ſin and miſery, into which he had plunged himſelf by his own folly and wickedneſs. (4.) The reaſon why I deny Mr. G's. Conſequence, that the giving unto Man any new Goſpel precept, would impeach the wiſdom and unchangeableneſs of God, is becauſe that his way of Arguing againſt any new Goſpel Precept, is upon the matter the very ſame way that the infidels of old, Diſputed againſt the truth of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and endeavoured to prove that either God could not be infinitely wiſe and unchangeable; or if he was <hi>ſuch,</hi> that then the Chriſtian Religion could not poſſibly be of God, becauſe there are new precepts in the Goſpel, and a new way of worſhipping God preſcribed by the Chriſtian Religion, different in ſeveral particulars, from that which was before preſcribed by God himſelf, both before and under the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> That thus the Infidels diſputed againſt the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, is evident by what is to be ſeen in <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> his Epiſtle to <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and by <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s anſwer to it; and it is to be noted that

                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Anſwer, neither did, nor could truly deny that ever God gave any new precepts to his People. So far was he from that way of Anſwering the Infidels, that on the contrary he confeſſed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93175:54"/>that God had indeed at different times, given to his Church new precepts different from former precepts; but with all he ſhewed, that this did no ways impeach either the wiſdom, or immutability of God. His excellent and Learned anſwer begins thus.

               <p n="3">(3.) His 3d Objection is in pag. 44. where he argues thus. Chriſt obeyed the Law, and therein fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, therefore the Law was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſince it was the rule of the moſt perfect obedience that ever was, and which excelled that of Angels. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whom doth this Brother diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt here? For my part, I do not know any of us that oppoſeth this. I am ſure if he underſtands the Apology which he writes againſt, he cannot but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93175:55"/>know that it is not denied but affirmed there, that the Law is perfect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires moſt perfect ſinleſsly perfect obedience, and that under pain of Death Eternal. See pag. 200. 201. of the Apology.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) His 4th objection is, Ibid. pag. 44. That <hi>if the Law be perfect, then it wants no precepts, but it enjoyns every duty under the ſevereſt penalties.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as the Law is moſt perfect <hi>in its kind,</hi> ſo indeed it wants not any one precept that <hi>belongs</hi> to it. But becauſe it wants not one precept that belongs to it, will Common ſenſe ſuffer a Man to infer that therefore it hath in it all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, that <hi>do not belong to it.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſpeaks here of the Law that Chriſt was under, and of the Law as it was, when Chriſt was under it in his State of Humiliation. Now I will name one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which the Law that Chriſt obeyed and fulfilled, had not then in it, and that was the precept recorded in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Of not eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Our bleſſed Lord moſt perfectly obeyed the <hi>Law that he was under.</hi> And yet he did not obey that <hi>particular precept</hi> of not eating the ſaid Fruit. If it be ſaid, that he did not diſobey that precept, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he obeyed it. I deny the Conſequence; obeying and diſobeying are not Contradictories, but contraries, and there is a medium or mean between them: And the <hi>mean</hi> was this, that our Lord Chriſt did neither obey nor diſobey that precept, of not eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge: Becauſe as it may be, there was no ſuch Tree or Fruit then in the World, ſo it is certain there was then no ſuch precept forbidding Chriſt, or any Man elſe to eat of the Fruit of that Tree; it was at firſt but a Temporary precept, and its obligation had ceaſed, and was utterly gone, long before the Son of God was made of a woman, made under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. Now where ſuch a precept doth not at all oblige, there is no place either for obedience or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the <hi>ſaid</hi> precept. I grant it to be a moſt certain truth that our Lord Chriſt ſuffered Death, the <hi>penalty</hi> threatned againſt Man for diſobeying <hi>that,</hi> and the other precepts; but it doth not at all follow from thence, that Chriſt either obeyed or diſobeyed <hi>that poſitive Temporary precept.</hi> He moſt perfectly obeyed <hi>every precept of any Law that he was under,</hi> and ſo fulfilled all Righteouſneſs: His Obedience alſo was <hi>equivalent,</hi> yea in reſpect of its worth ariſing from the infinite Dignity of his Perſon, it was <hi>more than equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> to all the Obedience which Mankind ſhould have performed to <hi>that</hi> and all other precepts; and yet for all that, it doth not follow that Chriſt in humane nature obeyed that precept, which was not then <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> ſo as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige any Man to obedience. The perfect Law then which Chriſt moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly obeyed, wanted the foreſaid precept, and yet it was perfect, becauſe it had all the precepts that belonged to it, and wanted only that which did not belong to it. Further, ſince my <hi>R. B.</hi> Speaks here of the Moral Law, it is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted and always was believed by me that it wants none of <hi>its own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and that by its own precepts it enjoyns every duty, <hi>In that way which God intended it ſhould enjoyn every duty.</hi> Thoſe duties which fall under its precepts without any ſupernatural Revelation intervening, and without any poſitive precept ſuperadded to the Law of Nature, it enjoyns and Commands by <hi>it ſelf immediately:</hi> But there are other duties which do not fall under its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, without a ſupernatural Revelation, and alſo without ſome poſitive precepts ſuperadded to the Law of Nature; and ſuch duties, it doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn and Command by <hi>it ſelf immediately;</hi> but only <hi>mediately</hi> and by means of the ſaid poſitive precepts, which do firſt in order of nature enjoyn and command the ſaid duties; and then the Moral Law enjoyns alſo and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93175:55"/>the ſame duties, by obliging us to obey the poſitive precepts which firſt in order of nature, require and enjoyn them. Thus, as hath been ſhewed, the Moral natural Law enjoyns and commands Faith in Chriſt, the Mediator, for Juſtification by his Righteouſneſs only; and Evangelical Repentance <hi>as a means to</hi> diſpoſe and quality us for obtaining the pardon of our ſins through Faith in Chriſts blood. It doth not by <hi>it ſelf immediately,</hi> require ſuch Faith and Repentance of all, without exception, that are under it: For then it would have required them alſo of Chriſt, who was made <hi>under the Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. It would have obliged the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus, to have believed in Chriſt for Juſtification; and to have repented Evangelically for obtaining the pardon of his ſins, through Faith in his own Blood: Which is abſurd and blaſphemous to aſſert: But it (ro wit the Moral Law) requires Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of all that are under it, <hi>mediately</hi> only, by means of the poſitive precepts of the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace, as hath been before explained and proved. But now ſo it is that the poſitive precepts of the Goſpel or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which require Faith in Chriſt the Mediator for Juſtification, and Evangelical Repentance as a means to diſpoſe and prepare us, for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardon of ſin; were not given unto Chriſt himſelf, to oblige him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to believe in himſelf for Juſtification, and Evangelically to repent for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin. And therefore the natural Moral Law which he was under, and perfectly obeyed, did not oblige him unto Juſtifying Faith, and Evangelical Repentance, as duties incumbent upon him, and to be performed by him in his own perſon. Thus we give (upon our principles) a clear account how our Lord Chriſt perfectly obeyed the Law, and yet was under no obligation at all to believe in himſelf for Juſtification, nor to repent for pardon of ſin; whereas it ſeems Mr. <hi>G.</hi> on his Principles, muſt either hold that Chriſt ſo believed in himſelf and repented; or elſe that he tranſgreſſed the perfect Law of God, by not ſo believing and repenting: Neither of which can be granted without the greateſt abſurdity Imaginable. If he ſhould here ſay, <hi>That I my ſelf have gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the moral natural Law obliges all that are under it to a Legal Repentance.</hi> But Chriſt himſelf was under it; and then it will follow, That he was obliged to a Legal Repentance; which is as bad as to hold, That he was obliged to an Evangelical Repentance. I could eaſily anſwer him, That he quite miſtakes the matter. I never ſaid, That the Law of Nature <hi>doth abſolutely and actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all that are under it to a Legal Repentance;</hi> but only that it ſo obliges all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <hi>that are ſinners, and upon ſuppoſition that they be ſinners.</hi> But now, our moſt holy Lord Jeſus was no ſinner, nor is it poſſible that he could be a ſinner; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he neither was, nor could poſſibly be obliged to a Legal Repentance of his ſins. My <hi>R. B.</hi> will not own himſelf to be an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and therefore I do not ſay that he holds with ſome of that Sect, that <hi>Christ believed for us</hi> with a Juſtifying faith, and <hi>repented for us,</hi> with an Evangelical Repentance, in that he perfectly kept the Moral Law, which by it ſelf immediately requires ſuch Faith and Repentance of all that are under it: Only I deſire him to guard againſt that Conſequence; and look well to it that it be not the natural off-ſpring of his beloved Opinion. If any man ſhould be ſo weak as to queſtion, <hi>How we can obtain pardon of the ſinful Defects of our Juſtifying Faith, and Evangelical Repentance, if Christ did not ſo believe and repent for us?</hi> I anſwer very eaſily, <hi>That we obtain pardon of the ſinful Defects of our Faith and Repentance, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſts meritorious and ſatisfactory Obedience unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi>

               <p>His 5th Objection is, <hi>ibid. p.</hi> 44. <hi>That the Moral Law, by its firſt Precept, commands us to believe in God, but Chriſt is God.</hi> This Argument he ſeems to lay great ſtreſs on, and yet it may be eaſily anſwered. For making this appear, we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between what the firſt Precept of the Moral Law, <hi>by it ſelf immediately,</hi> commands us to do, and what it commands us to do <hi>only by vertue of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation intervening, and by means of a poſitive Goſpel-Precept, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Law of Nature.</hi> This <hi>Diſtinction</hi> applied, clears <hi>the Matter,</hi> and anſwers <hi>the Argument;</hi> Thus: <hi>The firſt Precept of the Moral Law, by it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately commands us to believe in God only.</hi> The <hi>major Propoſition,</hi> in this ſenſe, is true, but then the <hi>minor Propoſition</hi> is falſe. It is falſe, That Chriſt is <hi>God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> For he is <hi>not only God, but Man alſo.</hi> He is God-Man, and Mediator between God and Men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. For there is one God, and <hi>one Mediator</hi> between God and Men, <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And then the Concluſion is falſe, taken (as it ought to be) <hi>in the ſame ſenſe,</hi> in which the Major propoſition is true. It is falſe that the firſt Precept of the Moral Law by it ſelf <hi>immediately,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Intervention</hi> of a <hi>Supernatural Revelation, and the ſuperadition of a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Goſpel precept,</hi> Commands us to believe in Chriſt the Mediator, for Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by his Righteouſneſs imputed to us. It is one thing to believe in God conſidered ſimply as God, and only God; and it is another thing to believe in Chriſt for Juſtification, conſidered <hi>not ſimply as God, or only as God;</hi> but conſidered <hi>as God-Man and Mediator</hi> between God and Men. The firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>by it ſelf immediately</hi> requires faith in God, ſimply conſidered <hi>as God,</hi> and <hi>only God,</hi> and Chriſt being really and truly God, I have granted and do grant, that the firſt Commandment by it ſelf immediately doth require faith in him, conſidered <hi>only as God;</hi> which yet <hi>is not a Juſtifying faith as ſuch.</hi> But then Chriſt being not <hi>only</hi> God, but Man <hi>alſo;</hi> he being <hi>God-Man,</hi> and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and Men, I deny that the firſt Commandment <hi>by it ſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> requires faith in him, <hi>as ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93175:56"/>the ſame I have ſaid and do ſtill ſay, of Evangelical Repentance, as a means of qualifying and diſpoſing Sinners for obtaining the pardon of their ſins by Faith in Chriſt. And here I may ſtop, and need not to go one ſtep further, in anſwering what he further Writes in his Seventh Chapter, to prove that the Moral Natural Law commands Faith and Repentance: for what I have ſaid already, doth ſufficiently anſwer whatever in it doth really militate againſt me. Moſt of it is altogether impertinent, as where he ſtrenuouſly proves what is not denyed, but was plainly owned and aſſerted in the <hi>Apology,</hi> that the Moral Natural Law requires Faith in God, and a legal Repentance, of all the ſinful Race of Mankind, that have the uſe of their Reaſon, and can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between Good and Evil, The reſt of it contains a meer <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> and is nothing but a drawing of conſequences violently againſt the hair, as that becauſe the Moral Natural Law, of it ſelf, requires a Legal Faith and truſt in God, and a Legal Repentance for Sin; therefore it ſo requires a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith in Chriſt the Mediator, and an Evangelical Repentance for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin; which doth not at all follow, as I have ſhewed and proved at large, and have no obligation on me to do it over again. I am ſenſible that my following him to lay open his Impertinences and Inconſequent Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hath already neceſſitated me to repeat too often the ſame things. I muſt therefore reſtrain my ſelf from purſuing him any further as I have done, and endeavour to come unto a ſpeedy cloſe of what is neceſſary to be ſaid on this Head, concerning the Precepts that belong to the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace: And, in order to this, there is no more needful to be done, but that (1.)

Whereas Mr. <hi>G.</hi> perpetually Talks of <hi>a New Law,</hi> and induſtriouſly labours to make People believe, that I hold the Goſpel to be a New Law of Duties, <hi>by and for which</hi> we are to be Juſtified and Saved: I declare that this is a groſs miſtake (to ſay no worſe of it) for I do not ſay that the Goſpel is ſimply <hi>a New Law,</hi> but with this mollifying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, that it is a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> or a <hi>New Law of Grace:</hi> So I ſay often in the Apology. And the reaſon of my ſaying ſo, is, becauſe the Goſpel conſiſts <hi>moſtly in Promiſes,</hi> though it <hi>be not without,</hi> but <hi>partly conſiſt in Precepts alſo.</hi> This I have ſhewed in the Apology, that there are not only <hi>Promiſes</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to thoſe who obſerve its Precepts, but that there are in it Promiſes of Grace to his People, to fit them for, and to aſſiſt them in the obſervance of its Precepts; and therefore it is fitly called not <hi>ſimply a Law,</hi> but <hi>a Law of Grace:</hi> So I call it, and believe it to be, and ſo it was called and believed to be, by other Orthodox Divines before I was born. But though I believe the Goſpel to be <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> that requires Duties to be performed by the Grace of the Spirit, and accepted through the Mediation of Chriſt; yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid, nor believed, that it is a Law which requires Duties, <hi>by and for which we are Juſtified and Saved.</hi> So far am I from ſaying or believing any ſuch thing, that I have publiſhed the contrary to the World in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Apology;</hi> and particularly in <hi>Page</hi> 38, 39, 40.54. Indeed, it is my profeſſed belief, that Faith it ſelf is not any the leaſt part of that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>by and for which</hi> we are Juſtified before God.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Second thing to be carefully attended unto, is, that by the Goſpel, or Law of Grace, I do not underſtand the Books of the New Teſtament; but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93175:57"/>the Covenant of Grace made with the Church through Chriſt, as it is Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures both of Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The Third thing to be attended unto, is, that I always acknowledged that the Firſt Commandment of the Moral Law obligeth to believe all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Revelations, and obey all the Poſitive Precepts of the Goſpel; from which Principle it is ſo far from following, that the Goſpel hath no Precepts of its own, that on the contrary it plainly follows, that it hath Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of its own, otherwiſe the Moral Natural Law would never oblige us to obey them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Fourth thing to be attended unto, is, That ſince the Goſpel, or Covenant and Law of Grace hath Precepts of its own; thoſe Precepts muſt of themſelves immediately oblige us to the performance of certain Duties, and by means of them the Natural Moral Law obliges us to the ſame Duties, tho not to be Juſtified and Saved <hi>for the ſake of thoſe Duties,</hi> but in order to other Goſpel ends and purpoſes. If theſe Four things be carefully attended unto, they will preſerve People, through the Bleſſing of God, from being impoſed upon by the falſe Repreſentation which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> gives of our Doctrine; which Wrong I freely forgive him, and heartily pray God both to give him Repentance and Forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Second and laſt thing I am here to do, is to ſhew my Reverend Brother ſome more of his Miſtakes, in this part of his Seventh <hi>Chapter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Precepts of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) And Firſt, whereas he ſays in <hi>Page</hi> 44. That the <hi>obedience</hi> of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not called <hi>Evangelical,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>obedience to the Goſpel, but becauſe of the Principles of Faith and Love from which it flows,</hi> and <hi>in reſpect of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Motives which animate and encourage it.</hi> This <hi>I</hi> take to be a miſtake, if he excludes the Goſpel Covenants, requiring ſuch Obedience, <hi>from being one of the ſaid Motives;</hi> and my reaſon is, becauſe the Goſpel's requiring it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Goſpel-ends and purpoſes, is the principal reaſon wherefore we call it E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Obedience. For it is the Goſpel that of it ſelf, directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, requires us to obey the Moral Law in ſuch an Evangelical way, to wit, ſincerely, with a renewed heart, from Principles of Faith in, and Love to Chriſt the Mediator, and God, as our Redeemer and Saviour by Chriſt. And further, as the Authority and Veracity of God revealing Truths to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is the formal reaſon of our Faith, which makes and denominates it a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith; ſo the Authority and Will of God commanding Duties to be done, is the formal reaſon of our obedience, which gives it the Denomination of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Obedience, or obedience to God. And if this be true of obedience to God in general, that it is <hi>called a Divine legal obedience, becauſe it is obedience to God's Authority and Will, Commanding</hi> it by his Law, then by Parity of Reaſon; it is true of that <hi>ſpecial ſort of obedience,</hi> to wit, <hi>Evangelical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> that <hi>it is called Evangelical, becauſe it is obedience to Gods Authority and Will, Commanding and requiring it by his Goſpel.</hi> It were very ſtrange, if the <hi>Formal Reaſon of Obedience</hi> did contribute nothing to the giving it <hi>its Name, as well as its Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas in <hi>Page</hi> 45. he ſays, <hi>That in</hi> John 14.1. <hi>Chriſt himſelf told his Diſciples, that they ſhould act faith on him, becauſe they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it by the ſame Command which required them to believe in God.</hi> This is another Miſtake, and the miſtake is the groſſer for this Reaſon, becauſe by this miſtake, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> impoſes upon our Saviour, and makes him to ſay, that which he did not ſay, nor is it implyed in, nor neceſſarily conſequent from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93175:57"/>his words. Our Lord Chriſt doth not ſay, Believe in me, <hi>becauſe ye are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it by the ſame Command which requires you to believe in God.</hi> This is Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Fancy, or Fiction, which he ſhould not have Fathered upon Chriſt: Who ſaith no ſuch thing in <hi>John</hi> 14.1. But only ſaith <hi>there,</hi> let not your heart be troubled, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Or as the words might be rendred <hi>ye believe in God, and ye believe in me.</hi> Now I appeal both to common ſenſe, and to common honeſty, and natural Conſcience, whether to ſay, <hi>ye believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> be all one and the ſame thing, as to ſay, <hi>ye ſhould believe on me, becauſe ye are obliged to believe on me, by the ſame command</hi> (and by no other) <hi>which requires you to believe in God.</hi> For ſuppoſe the Diſciples had been obliged to believe in Chriſt, <hi>by another Command,</hi> or <hi>both by the ſame and alſo by another Command,</hi> yet Chriſt might well have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame words, and have ſaid, <hi>ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> I do therefore put Mr. G. to prove, that becauſe our Lord Chriſt ſaid, <hi>ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Therefore he told his Diſciples, <hi>that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him,</hi> not becauſe they were obliged to it by any poſitive precept of the Goſpel, but <hi>only</hi> becauſe they were obliged to it, by the ſame Command of the Moral natural Law, which required them to believe in God. Mr G. muſt not dictate to us his own fancies, but muſt prove to us the foreſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence if he would have us to believe what he there ſays: For he ought not to think that we will believe it upon his bare word.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Thirdly, whereas he ſays, in p. 47. That <hi>the act and object of faith</hi> (to wit, faith in God before the fall, and faith in Chriſt after the fall) <hi>Is the ſame, (Chriſt being God) and all the difference is only made by that which is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (tho a deplorable one) of our own perſons.</hi> This is another great miſtake, for the object of faith in God before the fall, is not altogether the ſame, with the object of Juſtifying faith in Chriſt the Mediator, ſince the fall. And the object not being the ſame, the Act of faith is not the ſame, but is different in proportion to the difference of the object. Moreover as the objective cauſe, ſo the efficient cauſe is different; for <hi>the Medicinal Grace of Chriſt,</hi> which is the efficient cauſe of Juſtifying faith ſince the fall, is of a different nature from that Grace of God, as the Author of innocent nature, thereby Man was enabled to believe in God before the
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>See</hi> Rutherford's Covenant of Life opened, <hi>p.</hi> 49. <hi>lin.</hi> 16, 17.</note> fall. And ſeeing Juſtifying faith in Chriſt, ſince the fall, hath both a different efficient cauſe, and a different object together with a different habitude unto its object; it ſeems to be <hi>ſpecifically diſtinct</hi> from the faith which <hi>Adam</hi> had in God before the fall: For the different ſpecification of Acts ariſeth from the difference of the efficient cauſe, and object of the ſaid Acts, and from the <hi>different</hi> way of their being converſant <hi>about their reſpective Objects.</hi> It is not a meer <hi>different Circumſtance</hi> of our Caſe ſince <hi>the Fall,</hi> that cauſeth the difference of our <hi>Juſtifying Faith now,</hi> from <hi>the Faith</hi> of <hi>Adam then,</hi> before <hi>the Fall:</hi> But it is, (1.) The Difference of <hi>the Efficient Cauſe,</hi> or of <hi>that ſpiritual influence of Grace which cauſeth our Juſtifying Faith in Chriſt the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> (2.) It is <hi>the difference of the Object, which is not now God formally and ſimply conſidered as God the Creator and Preſerver and Ruler of innocent Nature; but nextly and immediately it is Chriſt conſidered as God-Man, and Mediator between God and Men,</hi> and <hi>ultimatly, it is God Juſtifying penitent believers by and for the alone Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It is the difference of our Faith, its Habitude and Relation from ſuch a different Cauſe to ſuch a different Object. Theſe Three differences are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93175:58"/>to make a different faith; but it doth by no Logick follow from hence, that every <hi>difference of Circumſtance,</hi> in the ſame ſtate of lapſed Nature, ſince the firſt Apoſtacy, would make our Faith in Chriſt to be of a different <hi>Nature and Kind.</hi> Now our Juſtifying Faith being thus <hi>different</hi> from the Faith of <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, it may very well, and it really doth fall under a different poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept, ſuch as that, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. And yet I never denied but that the firſt Commandment of the moral natural Law, doth alſo require this Faith, but it doth not require it <hi>after the ſame manner,</hi> as the poſitive Precept of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires it.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereas from <hi>page</hi> 48, to 54. he endeavours to prove, <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the natural Moral Law obliges all men to a natural Legal Repentance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth alſo of it ſelf immediately oblige them to an Evangelical Repentance;</hi> and <hi>that this it doth ſo as that there is no Poſitive Precept of the Goſpel which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of Chriſtians, and obliges them unto the ſaid Evangelical Repentance.</hi> In all his Diſcourſe there, he groſly miſtakes in drawing his Conſequence, which doth not come <hi>naturally,</hi> but is <hi>forcibly</hi> drawn againſt the clear Evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I have proved before; And therefore I utterly deny his Conſequence; and affirm on the contrary, That over and beſides the moral natural Law, there are Evangelical Precepts belonging <hi>to the New Covenant,</hi> or Law of Grace, which <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires</hi> of us an <hi>Evangelical Repentance,</hi> conſidered <hi>under this formal Notion, as ariſing from the perſwaſion of Gods Mercy in Christ to the truly penitent, and as a means to prepare and diſpoſe us for pardon, and as having pardon enſured to it by Promiſe through Chriſt. To ſuch a Repentance thus conſidered, the moral natural Law doth not by it ſelf immediately</hi> oblige us; and yet it was never denied by us, <hi>but that mediately it doth oblige us to it,</hi> in as much as it obliges us to obey the Poſitive Precepts of the Goſpel, which require ſuch a <hi>Repentance</hi> of men to whom the Goſpel is Preached.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whereas he ſays in <hi>page</hi> 51. <hi>That the moral natural Law, not only urgeth the unregenerate to Repentance, but alſo moveth them to build their hopes of Life upon it.</hi> That is a very groſs and dangerous miſtake. For it is a great ſin for unregenerate men (or indeed any men whatſoever) to build their hopes of life upon <hi>their Repentance;</hi> ſurely then the holy Law of God doth not move them to it, otherwiſe it ſhould move them to ſin; which is falſe, and borders upon Blaſphemy. The Truth is, The Law of God doth not move men to any ſuch Thing, it rather moves ſinners to deſpair of ever obtaining life by and <hi>for their Repentance,</hi> or any thing they do, or can do: And ſince, as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>The Goſpel inſtructs us to put our whole and entire confidence in Christ and his Righteouſneſs alone].</hi> Where <hi>the Light of the Goſpel</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſuperadded to that of <hi>the Law,</hi> there the Law is a <hi>School-Maſter</hi> to bring men to Chriſt; and Objectively moves them not to ſeek nor hope for Juſtification and Salvation on the Account of any thing done by Themſelves; but rather to ſeek and hope for life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only in Chriſt, and on <hi>the alone account of his Righteouſneſs and Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> have refuted his firſt grand Aſſertion, which he takes ſo much pains to prove in his Seventh Chapter, That the Goſpel hath no precepts, and requires no obedience. I have ſhew'd that it hath precepts, and requires duty and obedience of all thoſe unto whom it is Preached, and have anſwered his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the truth revealed in the ſacred Scriptures, and believed by the faithful Orthodox Miniſters, and People of the Lord in all the Ages of the <hi>Church.</hi>

               <p>His ſecond aſſertion is, that the Goſpel hath no threatnings. This I have refuted before in my remarks on his ſixth Chap. but as I ſaid there, I muſt make ſome further Animadverſions on it here, in its proper place. For the clearing up of the truth in this matter, conſider then, that the Goſpel-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant hath ſome threatnings againſt the unbelievers, and unregenerate, to whom it is preached, and other threatnings againſt regenerate believers. Firſt, the Goſpel-Covenant hath ſome threatnings againſt <hi>unregenerate unbelievers,</hi> to whom the Goſpel is Preached, and the deſign and uſe of ſuch threatnings, is to bring Men off from their unbelief, and to move them to believe in Chriſt, and to give themſelves up to him in Covenant, that by him they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both from the puniſhment threatned in the Law and Covenant of works, and alſo from that further degree of puniſhment, threatned in the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that neglect and refuſe to accept and make uſe of the Soveraign, and ſaving remedy provided by God and offered in the New Covenant, or Law of Grace. This I proved ſufficiently before, from <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19. and <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. and <hi>John.</hi> 12.48. To which Places may be added <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21, 22, 23, 24. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43, 44. and others. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Goſpel-Covenant <hi>hath Threatnings againſt Regenerate Believers,</hi> That in caſe they ſhould not perſevere to the end, in faith and holineſs, but ſhould totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fall away, they ſhould be moſt ſeverely puniſhed for their Apoſtacy. For the clearing of this, I will briefly do theſe Two Things: (1.) Show that there really are threatnings againſt regenerate believers, in caſe they ſhould Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize. (2.) That thoſe threatnings belong to the Goſpel. And (1.) That there are ſuch threatnings, appears from <hi>John</hi> 15.6. If a Man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered, and Men gather them and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned. Here is a threatning againſt thoſe who are in Chriſt, that if they abide not in him, they ſhall be burned. The like conditional threatning we have againſt the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> who were belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, and called to be Saints. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live</hi> after the fleſh, <hi>ye ſhall die;</hi> but <hi>if ye through the Spirit, do mortify</hi> the deeds of the body, <hi>ye ſhall live.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. v. 20, 21, 22. Thou ſtandeſt by faith, be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>fear.</hi> For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed loſt he alſo ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God: — Towards thee, goodneſs, <hi>If thou continue in his goodneſs: Otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> So we have recorded in the Scripture, a moſt terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> if they ſhould totally and finally Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; and that we might be ſure that the threatning is not only againſt hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion, but that it is alſo againſt Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Believers, upon ſuppoſition of their Apoſtacy, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> includes himſelf in the number of thoſe againſt whom he denounceth <hi>the Threatning;</hi> as it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. <hi>If we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledg of the Truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries.</hi> See alſo to this Purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. of which we ſpake in the Apology, p. 55. And take notice of what Mr. <hi>Dickſon</hi> obſerves on <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. How ſhall <hi>we</hi> eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> (ſaith Dickſon) <hi>Joyneth himſelf with them in the Threatning.</hi> And again, on <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.

Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Preachers ſhould do well to lay the edg of their threatnings to their own Hearts, and to Enroll themſelves amongſt the threatned,</hi> &amp;c. From theſe places of Scripture, and others that might be alledged to the ſame purpoſe, it manifeſtly appears that there are threatnings againſt Regenerate Believers, if they fall away. Now, in the ſecond Place, That the ſaid Threatnings do not belong only to the Law of Works, but that they are truly Threatnings that belong to the Goſpel-Covenant or Law of Grace, may thus appear. Regenerate Believers <hi>are not under the Law,</hi> Rom. 6.14. They are not under the <hi>Threatning, Condemning Power of the Law of Works.</hi> They are not only cauſally, but <hi>actually Redeemed from the Law's Curſe:</hi> Therefore the Threatnings wherewith they are conditionally Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are not Threatnings that belong to the Law of Works, as ſuch; but they are Threatnings that belong to the Goſpel-Covenant or Law of Grace, under which Believers are. <hi>I</hi> grant indeed, That (1.) True Regenerate Believers are not abſolutely under thoſe Threatnings, and that they are not bound to believe that thoſe Threatnings ſhall be Executed upon them. Nay, (2.) on the contrary, if they know themſelves to be true Regenerate Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and that none ſuch ſhall ever totally and finally fall away from Chriſt? I grant that they ought to believe that the ſaid threatnings ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be executed upon them. Yet for all that, it is evident by the Scriptures before mentioned, that true regenerate believers are conditionally under the ſaid threatnings, and are bound to believe that they would be executed and fulfilled upon them, if they ſhould totally and finally fall away. And our God in great wiſdom and mercy hath thus ordered his Covenant, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the foreſaid conditional threatnings, may be a means to preſerve his own people from Apoſtacy, and to make them perſevere in faith and holineſs to the end. According to that <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.40. I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. Compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. and 12.28, 29.

               <p>Mr. <hi>G.</hi> doth, or may know that this is no new ſingular opinion of mine, that the Goſpel hath its own threatnings, for as I ſhewed in the Apology p. 27. the Learned Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden</hi> were of the ſame Judgment before me. And ſo was Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> as appears by what I quoted out of him, there in p. 63. And Monſieur <hi>Turretin,</hi> as was ſhewed there alſo, in p. 103. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I now add other Teſtimonies as (1.)

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93175:60"/>that deſire further ſatisfaction in this matter, read <hi>there,</hi> what goes before and follows after this which I have here quoted; and they may find it in that large diſcourſe of the Learned Doctor. I could bring more witneſſes to give Teſtimony unto this truth, that the Goſpel hath its own proper threatnings, and to ſhew that it is no new notion of mine, no ſingular opinion of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting; but I need no more: Theſe are ſufficient to ſhew that it was the common faith of Chriſt's Church, before I was born, that it is ſo at this day, and I truſt, it will be ſo, after I am dead, and gathered to my Fathers.</p>
               <p>Having thus eſtabliſhed the truth, in the next place we muſt conſider what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> objects aginſt it; and for the proof of his Negative, that the Goſpel hath no threatnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. He firſt cites <hi>John</hi> 3.17. p. 54. <hi>For God ſent not his Son into the World to Condemn the World; but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, what then? Why then ſaith Mr. <hi>G. What could Chriſt have ſaid more to aſſure us, that in the Declaration of the Goſpel he did not threaten Death, but promiſe ſalvation to Sinners, whom the Law menaced, and who were Condemned by its ſentence.</hi> Anſwer, here is a piece of Confidence, that I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I have ever met with the like. Doth this brother think that he can draw Men to his opinion, by confident talk and big words, without ſo much as a ſhadow of right reaſon! For in this Argument there is not the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon. <hi>Chriſt tells us, that God ſent not his Son into the world to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved. Therefore he could have ſaid no more to aſſure us, that the Goſpel hath no threatnings, or that in the Declaration of the Goſpel, he did not threaten Death, but promiſe life to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> This Conſequence is ſuch as Mr. G. may be fond of, as being like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to his way of reaſoning in other parts of his diſcourſe; but I do not think that any Scholar who knows the rules of right reaſoning will ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it, or be convinced by it. For my part, I muſt ſay, that I have not known a Learned Man to have reaſoned ſo looſely and incoherently in a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter, of ſuch importance as this. If one ſhould ſeriouſly reaſon thus in the Schools of <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> &amp;c. I doubt not but he would be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ed at. And if he be not ſerious, but only writes thus to ſhew his wit, (which I cannot prove, and therefore will not affirm) I am ſorry that I ſhould have any thing to do with him. But ſuppoſing that he is himſelf miſtaken, and did not meerly deſign to act a part, and right or wrong to draw away Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after him; I owe him that ſervice of Love, as to ſhow him his miſtake, and direct him into the way of truth, which is that we all profeſs to Love and ſeek after: And it is no hard matter to do that, for in order thereunto there is no more needful but to tell Mr. <hi>G.</hi> that if our Lord Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>That God ſent not his Son into the world, to threaten the world with death in any ſenſe, but only to make an abſolute promiſe of Life to the world;</hi> Then he had ſaid a great deal more, (than he doth in <hi>John</hi> 3.17.) To aſſure us that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath no threatnings, or that in the Declaration of the Goſpel, he did not threaten Death, but promiſe Life to Sinners. For ſo, the thing had been <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably evident,</hi> to wit, that the Goſpel is nothing but an abſolute promiſe, and that it hath neither threatning nor conditional promiſe. Whereas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid no more in <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>But that God ſent not his Son into the world to Condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved:</hi> We can have no aſſurance at all from thoſe words, <hi>that the Goſpel hath no threatnings.</hi> For the Goſpel's having Conditional threatnings, that if Men do not believe and repent, they ſhall be Condemned, <hi>is ſo far from being inconſiſtent</hi> with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93175:61"/>Chriſt's not coming to Condemn, but to ſave the world; that on the contrary the ſaid conditional threatnings <hi>are one means to ſecure</hi> the world from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>and to bring</hi> them unto ſalvation. It ſeems Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> thinks, that if once the Goſpel threaten an unbeliever, by ſaying to him, if thou do not believe in Chriſt thou wilt be Condemned; the Man is undone for ever, he is Irrecoverably loſt, and cannot poſſibly be ſaved: But that is a very groſs miſtake, and ſuch a Conſequence is ſo far from being true; that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuch a conditional threatning may through the Grace of God, be an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to fetch the Man off from his unbelief, and to bring him unto faith in Chriſt, and through faith unto ſalvation. Hence Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 12.47. Saith p. 256. that <hi>not only rich promiſes, and gracious offers, but even ſharp threatnings are a means appointed of God, to ſtir up Men to embrace the Goſpel.</hi> And this is not only true of the ſharp threatnings of the Law, but it is true alſo of the threatnings of the Goſpel. Hence <hi>Julius Firmicus</hi> many hundred years ago ſaid,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſericordia Dei errantes homines corrigere frequenti comminatione Feſtinat. Jul. Firmic. Matern. de Errore Profan. Religionum, Pag. 80. Edit. <hi>Oxon.</hi> 1678.</note> 
                  <hi>[The mercy of God makes haſt to correct, or reclaim erring Men by frequent threatnings.</hi>] And our Saviour no doubt was of this mind when he gave Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and bids them go into all the World and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, ſaying, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be Damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 2dly, p. 54. He objects that <hi>John</hi> 12.47. Our Saviour ſaith, if any Man hear my words and believe not, I Judge him not: For I came not to Judge the world, but to ſave the world. And from theſe words, he infers, <hi>That Christ doth not threaten, much leſs Judge and Condemn an unbeliever.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that Mr. G. here draws two inferences from Chriſt's words <hi>John</hi> 12.47. (1.) That <hi>he doth not threaten</hi> an unbeliever <hi>now,</hi> becauſe he did not come to Judge, but to ſave the world <hi>then.</hi> (2.) That he <hi>doth much leſs Judge and Condemn</hi> an unbeliever <hi>now,</hi> becauſe he did not come to Judge, but to ſave the world <hi>then.</hi> Now neither of theſe inferences, would come freely and naturally from Chriſt's words, if Mr. G. did not draw them both by force and violence. And firſt, it doth not follow by any rule of right reaſoning. Chriſt did not then come to Judge, but to ſave the world. <hi>Therefore</hi> he doth not threaten an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. For both are very well conſiſtent, and he might do both. He might both come <hi>then,</hi> not to Judge but to ſave the world; and he might likewiſe threaten an unbeliever, and he may at this day threaten ſuch a perſon: His Judged, (that is, Damned) but ſaved, as was ſhewed before. Nor ſecondly, doth it follow by any true Logick. Chriſt did <hi>not then</hi> in his State of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation come to Judge, but to ſave the world. Therefore now in his State of Glorious Exaltation he doth not Judge, and Condemn an unbeliever. For if it be an unbeliever that lives and dies in unbelief; either he is not Judged and Condemned at all (which I hope Mr. G. will not ſay, unleſs he renounce his Creed and abjure the Chriſtian faith) or if he be Judged and Condmned, he is Judged and Condemned by Chriſt. For it is written <hi>John</hi> 5.22. That the father Judgeth no Man, but hath Committed all Judgment to the Son. I conceive the grounds of Mr. G's. miſtake are theſe two. (1.) His not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between the threatning of Condemnation, and the Condemnation it ſelf threatned. (2.) His not diſtinguiſhing on the one hand, between Chriſt's firſt coming in a State of Humiliation, to Preach the everlaſting Covenant,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93175:61"/>or Law of Grace, and to ratify and confirm it by his Death, and alſo to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for his People the ſalvation promiſed in the ſaid Covenant or Law of Grace: And on the other, his ordination to be the Judge of quick and dead (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.42.) Together with his ſecond glorious coming to Judge the world at the laſt day, according to the Goſpel. (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16). For if he had duly conſidered how diſtinct theſe things are, the one from the other; he might eaſily have ſeen that his conſequence is non-conſequent. There is no conſequential and true reaſoning from the denial of the Condemnation threatned, to the denial of the threatning it ſelf. Nor is there any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential and true Reaſoning from the denial of Chriſts Judging and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the world, <hi>then at his firſt coming</hi> in a State of Humiliation; to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of his Judging and Condemning of an unbeliever, <hi>now</hi> immediately after his Death, and <hi>hereafter</hi> at the general reſurrection. For, as hath been ſaid, Chriſt doth both. He did not <hi>first</hi> come to Condemn, but to ſave the world. And yet he both <hi>then</hi> threatned and <hi>now</hi> ſtill threatens unbelievers. He did not <hi>firſt</hi> come to Judge, but to ſave the world. And yet he doth <hi>now</hi> both Judge and Condemn the Soul of an impenitent unbeliever, immediately after Death, and will further both Judge and Condemn him Soul and Body, after the Reſurrection. Children that have learned their Catechiſm, do in part know theſe things. See the aſſemblies Annotations on <hi>John</hi> 3. v. 17. And on <hi>John</hi> 12.47. And <hi>Pool's</hi> Annotations 2d volume, on <hi>John</hi> 12.47.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſcourſe of the true nature of the Goſpel, c. 7. p. 54.</note> But if Chriſt's words in <hi>John</hi> 12.47.

               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>Chriſt is a Mediator, and the Saviour of the world; therefore Chriſt is not the Judge of the world, nor doth he threaten to Condemn an unbeliever.</hi> And becauſe he knew that the Conſequence would be denied, as moſt falſe and impious, and contrary to a fundamental Article of the Chriſtian Religion. He labours to prove it. But how doth he prove it? Why, his way of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is extraordinary and <hi>perculiar</hi> to himſelf. For in order to prove, that becauſe Chriſt is a Saviour and Mediator, <hi>therefore he is not the Judge of the world,</hi> no, not of an <hi>unbeliever</hi> in the world, he aſſerts two things. (1.) That <hi>Chriſt knew that the office of a Judge, did not belong to a Mediator.</hi> (2.) <hi>That Chriſt diſowned the office of Judge, as not belonging to a Mediator.</hi> (1.) Mr. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win <hi>affirms, that Chriſt knew that the office of a Judge did not belong to a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi> Now Reverend Sir, if I dare be ſo bold, let me ask you, how do you know that Chriſt knew this. Surely, if you know this, (which is a ſecret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to other Men), it muſt be by Chriſt's telling you that he knows it. I demand then, <hi>where</hi> and <hi>how</hi> did Chriſt tell you this ſecret? Hath he told you it in any part of the Holy Scriptures of the old or New Teſtament? If ſo, be pleaſed to do me the favour to tell me the Chapter and Verſe, that I may likewiſe know it. For tho I have read the Bible, yet ſeriouſly I profeſs not to have met with any one paſſage in it, which diſcovers to me that ſecret. <hi>That Chriſt knew, that the office of a Judge did not belong to him, becauſe he is a Mediator.</hi> Or will you ſay, that Chriſt hath not told you this ſecret, by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93175:62"/>Scripture but by an immediate Revelation, without Scripture? If you give me this anſwer, I reply. (1.) That you muſt prove that you have ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation from Chriſt; for I cannot believe you in this matter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your bare word. (2.) If you had it by immediate Revelation only, I hope you will not be offended with me, tho I do not believe it, till it be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately revealed to me alſo. (3.) Chriſt hath been ſo far from telling you either mediately or immediately, by an outward and written, or by an inward and unwritten Revelation that <hi>he knows that the office of a Judge, did not belong to him, ſince he is Mediator;</hi> That he has plainly enough told you the contrary (if you had eyes to ſee and a heart to believe it); for thus it is written, and they are the expreſs formal words of Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>John</hi> 5.22. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgeth no Man, but <hi>hath committed all Judgment to the Son.</hi> Now the Son is certainly Mediator. Therefore the Father hath committed all Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Mediator. And ſince the Father hath committed <hi>all Judgment</hi> to the Son, and Mediator, ſurely <hi>the office of a Judge belongs to the Mediator, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of the Father's <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> And this Chriſt knows to be true, and hath told it plainly unto us by his Evangeliſt <hi>John.</hi> And if you would have it told you yet more plainly, be pleaſed to read and conſider the 27 verſe of the ſame 5th Chapter of <hi>John.</hi> Where Chriſt ſays, That <hi>the Father hath given the Son Authority to execut Judgment, becauſe he is the Son of Man.</hi> On which place the aſſemblies Annotations have this note. Authority to execute Judgment is <hi>[Supream power to Govern and Adminiſter all things].</hi> Becauſe he is the Son of Man. That is [<hi>Not only as he is God, but alſo as he is Man, that all Men may ſee their Judge.</hi> Rev. 1.7.] And on the ſame, <hi>John</hi> 5.27.

                  <hi>Ibid. Doctrin.</hi> 3. Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſaith that <hi>Christ hath a donative Kingdom, as Mediator, God-Man, for the good of his Church,</hi> &amp;c. And Doct. (6.)

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Indeed his Confidence in this, is well grounded; for we really have, (as we ought) a very great regard to theſe, <hi>and all the other words of our moſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93175:63"/>bleſſed and glorious Lord,</hi> and they have a Commanding power over us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to receive them with faith and love. But what then, muſt we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have regard to <hi>Mr. G</hi>'s. Conſequence which he draws from them by force and violence? That doth not at all follow. And for my own part, I declare that I reject his Conſequence, which is that the Goſpel, or Covenant, and Law of Grace hath no threanings, ſince he that believeth not, is Condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; <hi>Becauſe he hath not believed in the Name of the only-begotten Son of God.</hi> And whereas he ſays, that the unbeliever is already Condemned by the old Law of works, and therefore <hi>there is no need,</hi> that he be Condemned again by the Goſpel and a new Law of Grace. I Anſwer that a Man who lives under the Preaching of the Goſpel, and yet remains ſtill in unbelief, is already Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned both by Law and Goſpel, by the old Covenant and alſo by the New, ſo long as he continues in his unbelief, as I ſhewed before. And it doth not become us to ſay unto God, that he needs not to do the ſame thing twice, when we know that he hath twice done it; eſpecially when we may plainly ſee that tho the ſame perſon be twice over Condemned, yet it is in different reſpects and for two different cauſes. Firſt he is Condemned by the old Law of works, for not keeping it perfectly and perſonally, ſo as never to break it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by original or actual ſin. And thus all Unbelievers in the world are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, even Heathens, that never heard the joyful ſound of the Goſpel, and never had a Goſpel-Offer of Mercy, upon the Terms of the New Covenant, and Law of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is condemned alſo by the Goſpel, or New Covenant, &amp; Law of Grace, for not accepting the Goſpel-Offer of Mercy, for not receiving and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to himſelf the Remedy tendred to him in the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace. Here this Unbeliever is guilty of a ſin which the foreſaid Heathens, who have only the Law of Nature, are not guilty of; he is guilty of a ſin which is directly and immediately againſt the ſaving Remedy mercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and offered him in the Goſpel; and therefore there is ſufficient Reaſon for condemning him again by the Goſpel-Covenant, I ſay, for condemning him to a greater Degree of Puniſhment, than that of meer Heathens, who are guilty only of ſins againſt the Law of Nature, but are guilty of no ſin againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt; are not at all guilty of any ſin in neglecting or refuſing to receive Chriſt by Faith, and the Salvation offered through him in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant. Our Saviour ſays in this very Text, That the Unbeliever, who is guilty of Poſitive Unbelief againſt the Goſpel, <hi>is condemned already,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and meerly becauſe he hath broken God's natural moral Law, but becauſe he hath not believed <hi>in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And then (as it were to obviate Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Objection, he adds immediately, <hi>This is the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that light is come into the world, and Men loved Darkneſs rather than Light,</hi> Becauſe their deeds were Evil. See what was quoted before, in the remarks on Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. ſixth Chapter, out of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon's</hi> Expoſition, on <hi>John</hi> 3. v. 18.19.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Confirmation or Illuſtration of his fourth objection, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon taken from <hi>An Earthly Phyſitian, who threatens his patient with Death, if he do not take the preſcribed Phyſick; And yet the threatning is no part of the medicine, nor doth the Phyſitian deſign to murder his patient by the ſaid threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> It is like all the reſt, of no force at all againſt the Goſpel's having threatnings of its own. For the <hi>just Conſequence</hi> can be <hi>no other</hi> but <hi>this,</hi> That juſt ſo; tho the Goſpel threaten an unbeliever with Eternal Death, if he do not, by a true Faith, receive Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs offered to him in the new Covenant or Law of Grace, yet the threatning is no part of Chriſt and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93175:64"/>his Righteouſneſs which is to be received, as the ſpiritual Phyſick of the Soul; nor doth the Goſpel deſign by the ſaid threatning to damn the unbeliever, but rather it deſigns to take him off from his unbelief, and to induce him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to believe in Chriſt, and by believing to receive and apply the Spiritual Phyſick offered him to preſerve his Soul from Eternal Death. This now is the juſt Conſequence, and it is ſo far from militating againſt my principle, that it rather makes for it, and is an Illuſtration of it. For theſe two things I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant. (1.) That tho the Goſpel Covenant do threaten an unbeliever with Eternal Death, and the threatning is a ſecondary ſubſervient part of the ſaid Goſpel-Covenant; yet the threatning is no part of the Spiritual Phyſick it ſelf, to wit of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs revealed and offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant to be received by faith, that by the Spiritual Phyſick, ſo receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Soul may be ſaved from Eternal Death. (2.) I grant, that the Goſpel doth not deſign by its threatning to damn the Soul of the unbeliever, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it deſigns to preſerve him from Damnation, by taking him off from his unbelief, and by perſwading him to believe in Chriſt, that through him he may have Eternal Life. And <hi>here I deſire it may be remembred,</hi> That I do not ſpeak of the <hi>deſign of any perſon,</hi> but of the <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-threatning,</hi> and I ſay that the deſigned uſe of it, is not to damn the unbeliever, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bring him off from his unbelief, and ſo to preſerve him from Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. According to that of <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. Knowing the terror of the Lord, we perſwade Men. And that of <hi>Jude.</hi> Others ſave with fear, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them out of the fire. <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle. v. 23. And this way of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave Souls by Goſper-threatnings, was according to the Commiſſion for Preaching the Goſpel, which the Apoſtles received from Chriſt: As was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before from <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. I conclude this with the words of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj,</hi> 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He argues thus, p. 56. <hi>If any promiſes of the Goſpel were condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, they would not differ in kind, but only in degree from the promiſes of the Law; for both would be made to obedience, with this only difference that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Law are made to obedience in the higheſt degree of ſinleſs perfection; whereas the promiſes of the Goſpel are made to obedience in a lower degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that is, to obedience which is ſincere, tho it be not ſinleſsly perfect. And, the conſequence of this would be, that the Covenant of Grace would be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works contrary to</hi> Rom. 11.6.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that this <hi>R.</hi> brother like a <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> jumbles together and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds, things that ſhould be ſeparated and ſpoken unto diſtinctly. <hi>To wit, the conditional promiſes of Juſtification and Pardon of ſin; And the conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Glorification and Conſummate ſalvation.</hi> Of the firſt ſort of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Evangelical Faith and Repentance are the Condition: And of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort, ſincere obedience Evangelical flowing from faith, with perſeverance therein to the end, is the condition. Now (1) for the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Juſtification, to wit Evangelical Faith and Repentance, they are not at all required in any degree by the old Law, ſtrictly taken for the Covenant of works, nay, the old Covenant or Law of works, as ſuch, is ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring them, that it doth not admit them, but <hi>of its own nature</hi> it Rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſts upon, and demands a ſinleſsly perfect, perpetual obedience to all its precepts, and a perſonal Righteouſneſs abſolutely compleat, in all parts and in all degrees, without the leaſt ſinful defect. This and this only is the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the old Covenant of works requires, as its condition: And upon this condition, and for this obedience and perſonal Righteouſneſs alone, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93175:65"/>to Men (not pardon of ſin, but) Juſtification and Life Eternal. By this it plainly appears that the conditions of the promiſes of the old Covenant of works, and of the new Covenant of Grace, with reſpect to Juſtification, differ not meerly in degree, but they differ in kind.

Tho the precepts of the Moral natural Law, conſidered <hi>as ſtript of their old Covenant form,</hi> Do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Evangelical Faith and Repentance, as they require us to believe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the precepts of the New and Goſpel-Covenant: Yet this they do only mediately and conſequentially: For it is the New and Goſpel-Covenant it ſelf, which doth immediately and directly, by its own precepts, require of us Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Faith and Repentance, in order to Juſtification and Pardon of ſin. (3.) Tho the New and Goſpel Covenant or Law of Grace, doth require of us both Evangelical Faith and Repentance, as neceſſary, in order to Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pardon of Sin; Yet it is with this difference; that it requires Faith as moſt properly <hi>the condition</hi> of the Covenant-Promiſe of Juſtification; but it requires Evangelical Repentance, only <hi>as a Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this difference, I aſſigned in the Apology, thus: Faith is moſt properly the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant-Promiſe of Juſtification, becauſe it is that condition or Inſtrumental means whereby we receive, apply and truſt the object (Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs) <hi>by, and for which only</hi> we are Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Pardoned; but Evangelical Repentance is moſt fitly called <hi>a Condition</hi> of the Covenant-Promiſe of Juſtification or <hi>Pardon</hi> of ſin, becauſe it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (not <hi>receptive</hi> of the Object, Chriſt, as Faith is, but) <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſpoſitive of the Subject, man,</hi> ſo neceſſary in order to his being Juſtified or Pardoned, that the Lord Suſpends the Pardoning of Man's Sins, till he hath, through Grace, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Repented of them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. And this is exactly agreeable to the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> as I ſhewed before; and likewiſe to the Judgment of Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> on John 3.18. Doctrine 4. His words are, pag. 40. <hi>(Albeit, ſuch as flee to Chriſt, and expect not to be Condemned, ought to ſtudy Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee God; yet the Condition required for reverſing the Sentence, and Abſolving the Self-condemned Sinner, is only Faith put in Exerciſe, as laying hold on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, which alone can Anſwer the Law, and endureth conſtantly; whereas our Holyneſs is imperfect and variable like the Moon; therefore it is, he that believeth on him, or, hath Faith in Exerciſe, not in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit only, that is not Condemned).</hi> (4.) Hence it follows that tho Juſtifying Faith be required by a Precept of the Goſpel-Covenant (as our Confeſſion of Faith, Chap. 7. Art. 3. ſaith expreſly, That it requires Faith) and tho by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Juſtifying Faith is an Act of Obedience to that Goſpel-Precept which requires it; yet it doth not follow, that therefore we are Juſtified by it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſimply as an Act of Obedience: For if ſo, then (ſince a <hi>quatenus ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne valet conſequentia</hi>) we ſhould be a-like Juſtified by any other Act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is falſe. But, as Mr. <hi>Hutcheſon</hi> ſaid, Faith, above all other gracious Acts, having an <hi>aptitude</hi> for that uſe, and being <hi>only appointed by God to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> juſtifies us, or we are juſtified by it alone, as <hi>laying hold on Chriſt and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and as truſting in Christ and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> which alone can anſwer the Law, and Juſtice of God. 5.) And hence appears one Eſſential ſpecifical Difference between the Old Law, or Covenant of Works, and New Covenant of Grace, that tho (as <hi>Eſſenius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Compend. Dogm. Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>pag.</hi> 428. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 12.) Obedience be required in them both; yet in the Old Covenant of Works, Man's own Perſonal Obedience was required, not only as the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Juſtification, but as <hi>the only Righteouſneſs, by and for</hi> which he could be juſtified, according to that Covenant. Whereas, in the New Covenant of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93175:65"/>Grace, there is a <hi>Mediator,</hi> by and for whoſe Mediatorial Righteouſneſs alone we are juſtified; and not one Act of our own Perſonal Obedience is required, as <hi>that Righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>any par</hi> of that Righteouſneſs by and for which we are Juſtified and Pardoned. Neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith nor Repentance are required by the Precepts of the Goſpel, as <hi>any part</hi> of that Obedience and Righteouſneſs by and for which we are Juſtified: but Repentance is only required as <hi>a Condition or Means</hi> to diſpoſe and prepare the Subject, <hi>Man,</hi> who is to be juſtified: And Faith is required <hi>as the Condition,</hi> or <hi>Inſtrumental Means</hi> to receive, apply and truſt the Object, to wit, Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>by and for which alone</hi> we are juſtified. Now this alone (though there are many other Reſpects in which they differ) is abundantly ſufficient to ſhew, That there is more than a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, even a ſpecifical difference between the Two Covenants aforeſaid, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Juſtification. Their Conditions differ in <hi>kind,</hi> and <hi>ſo doth</hi> the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <hi>for which the two Covenants</hi> do reſpectively juſtifie ſuch Perſons as come up to, and comply with their Terms and Conditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the Condition of the New Covenant-Promiſe, of Glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſummate Salvation, to wit, ſincere Eaangelical Obedience, tho materially conſidered, it is partly the ſame with, yet it is <hi>alſo partly different from that Legal Obedience</hi> which was required as the Condition of the Old Law and Covenant of works; for there are ſome Poſitive Precepts which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the New and Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, that did not at all exiſt of Old, and ſo could not then belong to the Old Law, or Covenant of Works. Therefore ſince the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, hath now ſome Poſitive Precepts different from the Precepts of the firſt Old Covenant, and Law of Works, it follows neceſſarily, That the Obedience required by the Precepts of the Goſpel, muſt be partly alſo different from the Obedience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the firſt Covenant, and Old Law of Works. But now, if we conſider the Obediences required by <hi>the ſaid Two Covenants,</hi> as <hi>the Two Conditions of their reſpective Covenants,</hi> ſo they differ formally in Kind, and not meerly in Degree; for they proceed from different Principles, they have different formal Motives, and ſerve to different ends and purpoſes. The moſt perfect legal obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as the Condition of the firſt Covenant and Law of works, was <hi>The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Righteouſneſs by and for which Man</hi> was to have been juſtified and to have lived by that Covenant, if he had kept it: But now the ſincere Evangelical obedience required as a Condition, on our part, of the new Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Glorification and Conſummate ſalvation, is not any the <hi>leaſt part</hi> of that meritorious Righteouſneſs, for which alone we obtain poſſeſſion of Eternal Glory and Conſummate ſalvation. And as for the promiſes themſelves of the two Covenants, they alſo are ſpecifically different, becauſe they have different impulſive and moving cauſes of their firſt making, and are performed for different and formal fundamental Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In the Covenant of Works it was indeed of God's <hi>free goodneſs and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious condeſcention,</hi> that he promiſed a Reward to our firſt Parents, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perfect Obedience. But in the Second, and New Covenant of Grace, it is <hi>of his Rich Mercy in Christ,</hi> that he promiſed us Eternal Life and Glory, on condition of our ſincere Evangelical Obedience, and Perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs to the End. So that they <hi>have different impulſive Cauſes of their firſt making;</hi> And being ſo made, they are at laſt performed for <hi>different formal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Reaſons.</hi> If the firſt Covenant of Works had been kept, the Promiſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e would have been performed and made good to man <hi>for his own perſonal Obedience, as his Righteouſneſs, his only Righteouſneſs in the ſight of God.</hi> But now the Goſpel, or New Covenant-Promiſe of Eternal Life and Glory, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93175:66"/>and made good to the People of God, <hi>not for their own perſonal ſincere Obedience, but only for the moſt perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them.</hi> So that as <hi>the impulſive cauſes of making,</hi> in like manner the <hi>formal Motives and Fundamental reaſons of performing the</hi> ſaid ſeveral promiſes of the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, do greatly differ, and therefore the promiſes themſelves <hi>differ in kind. Now</hi> it is <hi>in Chriſt</hi> that <hi>all the promiſes</hi> of God, <hi>are yea,</hi> and it is <hi>in Chriſt</hi> that <hi>they are Amen;</hi> unto the Glory of God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Thus I have Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his firſt Argument at large. And hence it manifeſtly appears, that his Conſequence is inconſequent and will not hold, to wit, that upon our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Covenant of grace, would be a Covenant of works, for I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the two Covenants differ ſpecifically and in kind, and that tho both require obedience and works, yet they are much different from one another, and in order to far different ends and purpoſes. The works required by the firſt and old Covenant, were legal works that were to be the only Righteouſneſs, <hi>by and for which</hi> Man was to be juſtified and to live, but the works required by the ſecond, new and Goſpel-Covenant, are Evangelical works which are <hi>no part of the Righteouſneſs by and for which,</hi> we are juſtified and pardoned, ſaved and glorified. Thus it is manifeſt, that we do not abſurdly confound the two Covenants of Law and Goſpel, but he draws ſilly Conſequences from our Principles which he ſeems not to underſtand, and builds Caſtles in the Air, which tumble down for want of a ſolid Foundation. And the worſt of it is, that he wreſts the Holy Scripture which ought carefully to be avoided, as that which may be the occaſion of ſome other's deſtruction, if not of our own. The place of Scripture which he wreſts both in p. 56. and 63. Is that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. Where to make it ſerve his purpoſe, he ſuppoſes (1.) That in the words. <hi>[Then is it no more of works]</hi> by the relative <hi>[it]</hi> muſt neceſſarily be meant <hi>the Covenant of Grace.</hi> (2.) He ſuppoſes, that by the ſaid words [then is <hi>it no more of works</hi>] muſt needs be meant, <hi>Then the Covenant of grace requires no ſort of obedience, nor any kind of works in order to any Goſpel end and purpoſe.</hi> (3.) He ſuppoſes that the <hi>works</hi> there excluded by the Apoſtle, are not <hi>only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious works, but any ſort of Commanded duties,</hi> tho <hi>no way Meritorious nor conceived ſo to be.</hi> And then from the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus perverted, he infers his Concluſion, that it would be a flat Contradiction to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. If the Covenant of Grace had any conditional promiſes, and if it required any duty, and obedience, or any ſort of work at all. I freely grant that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is good from the foreſaid three ſuppoſitions. But I utterly deny all the three ſuppoſitions, and I know my <hi>R. B.</hi> cannot prove them to Eternity. If he thinks he can, let him try his Skill; for I put him to it. But withal, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to take heed what he doth; God will not be mocked; nor ſuffer his word to be abuſed without controll. If he ſhall ſay that he doth not ſuppoſe the three things aforeſaid. I Anſwer that he doth and muſt ſuppoſe them, or elſe he groſsly abuſes the words of the Apoſtle, by wreſting and wringing out of them a ſenſe that was never in them. For underſtand the Apoſtle's words, as he meant them, and they make nothing for his purpoſe at all, nor will they bear the inference that he deduces from them. To make this appear, conſider. (1.) That the thing which the Apoſtle aſſirms there to be of Grace, and denies to be of works, is not the Covenant of Grace (of which he doth not <hi>there</hi> ſpeak), but it is either <hi>the Election,</hi> or <hi>the reſerving of the Remnant,</hi> of which he ſpeaks in the foregoing verſe. (2) Conſider that by ſaying <hi>it is of grace</hi> and <hi>not of works,</hi> he means <hi>that grace,</hi> and <hi>not works,</hi> was the impulſive, moving cauſe of the <hi>ſaid Election,</hi> or <hi>of the reſcrving of a Remnant at</hi> that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93175:66"/>time: But he doth not at all mean that, becauſe the Covenant is of Grace, therefore it requires no works, no obedience, nor duties at all. (3.) Conſider that the works whish he excludes are <hi>only Meritorious</hi> works, becauſe they are ſuch works, as are utterly inconſiſtent with and Deſtructive of Grace. Now my Judgment is, that the Particle <hi>[it]</hi> in our Tranſlation of <hi>v.</hi> 6. Refers to the word <hi>[Election]</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 5. And then the ſenſe, is, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Annotators on <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. Give it us, thus. [And if it be by grace, <hi>[Namely, that thoſe are Elected to ſalvation, and effectually called],</hi> It is no more [or, <hi>Then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not]</hi> of works <hi>[That is, of the Merits or Dignity of their works.</hi>] Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>[Namely, if it were of works only,</hi> or, <hi>of grace and works together]</hi> grace is no more grace <hi>[Namely, for as much as grace excludes all debt, Merit or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs, and cannot conſiſt therewith: For grace is no wiſe grace, if it be not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way grace,</hi> Rom. 4.4.] And if it be of works, it is no more grace: <hi>[Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but a deſerved reward,</hi> i. e. <hi>then their Election and Calling was not done of grace.]</hi> Otherwiſe the work is no more work. <hi>[That is no work, of Merit].</hi> Thus they excellently well expound that 6 verſe of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. And refer it to the Election mentioned in the 5 verſe, ſo as not to exclude, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the reſerving of an Elected remnant of <hi>Jews,</hi> and their effectual calling to Faith in Chriſt. After the ſame manner doth Mr. <hi>Mayo</hi> explain the ſame words. In the 2d Vol. of <hi>Pool's</hi> Annotations, on <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. He writes thus. <hi>[The Apoſtle takes occaſion here, to ſhew that Election and Vocation is only by grace and not by works.—And here he delivers a truth, which the</hi> Jews <hi>of old, either could not, or would not underſtand,</hi> i. e. <hi>that there is no mixing of the Merit of good works, and the free grace of God: But one of theſe doth exclude and deſtroy the nature of the other: For if Election and calling were,</hi> &amp;c.] Let the Reader conſult the whole Paſſage. It is too large for me to Tranſcribe, but it is ſo well done, that I do moſt heartily approve of it. Now this being the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of that place of Sctipture, let Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> prove (if he can) that becauſe Election from Eternity, and Effectual calling in time is <hi>of grace</hi> and <hi>is not of Merit of works, either foreſeen</hi> before Election, or really wrought before effectual calling: Therefore the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace hath no conditional promiſes, and doth require no duty (no, not Faith in Chriſt) nor no obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or work of obedience at all. I am ſure, that no Man living can prove that Conſequence by one ſolid Argument. It may be, my <hi>R. B.</hi> will be more moved with the words of the Learned <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> then with mine; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will cite him a paſſage out of a Writing of that Learned Author. His words are

                  <hi>[No Scripture telleth that our Election to Life dependeth on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Faith and Obedience. Faith and Obedience are the effects (not the cauſe) of our Election, and are Conditions following Election, not going before it; as it is written</hi> Acts 13.48.] Here <hi>Ainſworth</hi> acknowledges that tho Faith and obedience be not the cauſe, but the effects of Election, yet that hinders not their being <hi>conditions.</hi> And I add that tho they are effects not only of election but of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Vocation, yet they are Conditions, with reſpect to the ſubſequent bleſſings of the Covenant. And if they be Conditions, then there are Conditional Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Goſpel-Covenant; and it requires of us ſome Duties, and Works of Obedience; and though this be moſt true, yet doth it not follow from hence, by any true Logick, <hi>That the Goſpel will be only the ſuperannuated Law of Works revived, with ſome abatements of its required Duties.</hi> Prove this Conſequence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93175:67"/>if you can, I put you to it; but take heed that you do not lay your ſelf fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open, and diſcover your own weakneſs in the doing of it.

               <p>There is one thing more in his 56th Pag. that needs correction, and that is, what he <hi>ſaith of God's conditional Promiſes being made to Men,</hi> upon ſuch and ſuch a condition, I humbly conceive this is a miſtake: One Man indeed may <hi>make</hi> a promiſe to another Man, upon a condition, <hi>ſo as to ſuſpend the very making of the promiſe upon the condition,</hi> and if the other Man <hi>do not accept or perform the condition, the promiſe is not made to him at all;</hi> but I think it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe between God and Man. God is infinitely Superiour to us, and he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely makes his conditional Promiſes to us, without asking our conſent. I ſay, that God's making of the conditional Promiſe is abſolute, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made is conditional; and God preſcribes the Condition to us, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to perform it: But then God performs the ſaid Promiſe conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that is, He ſuſpends his own Tranſient Act of giving us the Benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed conditionally, till we, through Grace, have performed the Condition; And if the Condition be never performed by us, God never gives the Benefit promiſed unto us. This is no new Notion of mine, I have not ſo good an Opinion of my own Abilities, as to venture upon new Notions in Divinity: It is enough for me, and I hope I ſhall, through Grace, be thankful to God for it, if he be pleaſed to enable me to contend, as I ought to do, for the Faith which was <hi>once</hi> delivered to the Saints, <hi>Jude,</hi> v. 3. This Notion, I ſay, is none of mine, but it is the Learned and Pious <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s, as is to be ſeen in his Book of <hi>the Covenant of Life opened,</hi> Part I. P. 91, 92. <hi>[Nor is it true, that the Promiſe is made to the Aged, upon condition of Believing: The Promiſe is made to them abſolutely, whether they Believe or not: But the Bleſſing of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Covenant of Grace is given and beſtowed only conditionally, if they Believe. The Promiſe is abſolutely made: It is called conditional from the thing conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given.]</hi> Thus <hi>Rutherford.</hi> And accordingly, whenever I ſay, That God hath promiſed a Benefit to Men upon a Condition, I deſire it may be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. For I mean no more, than that God hath made to Men a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſe, that he preſcribes to them the Condition, and will give them the Benefit promiſed if they perform the Condition preſcribed, and not till then: But I do not mean, that God <hi>conditionally makes</hi> the Promiſe to Men, <hi>ſo as to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his making of it,</hi> till they perform the Condition: And it may be, my <hi>R.

He argues againſt the Goſpel's having any Conditional Promiſes, thus, P. 57. <hi>If the Goſpel be a New Law, [or, Covenant] of Grace, that hath Conditional Promiſes,</hi> (ſo it ſhould be expreſſed, or it doth not concern me at all) <hi>it will follow, that God in the Promulgation of this New-Law, or Covenant of Grace, offers Life univerſally to all Men; to Tartars, Negroes, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages in</hi> America; <hi>to all the Nations from</hi> Peru <hi>to</hi> Japan, <hi>on condition they Obey the Command of the Goſpel, and Believe and Repent.</hi> I Anſwer, That conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is falſe; No ſuch thing doth follow from the aforeſaid Antecedent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God Promulgate the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, to all thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nations without exception, as he hath Promulgated it to us in theſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93175:67"/>parts of the World. For the Goſpel Covenant, or Law of Grace, being a poſitive Conſtitution of God, and having the force of a poſitive Law, not knowable by the meer Light of Nature, it doth not oblige any Man to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and to be Subject and Obedient unto it, unleſs it be ſufficiently Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated to him. Either then prove, that the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, (which are the ſame) is ſufficiently Promulgated to all the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned People and Nations, or elſe you muſt let go that conſequence as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſequent. This you ſeem to be ſenſible of, and therefore you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove, that God hath Promulgated the Goſpel-Covenant or Law of Grace to all Men in the world, without exception; a bold undertaking! Now let us hear the proof; why thus it is: <hi>If God in giving his Moral Law to all reaſonable Creatures, ſaid univerſally to Angels and Men, [do this, and you ſhall live] by the ſame rule, if the Goſpel is a New Law, God ſpeaks generally to all Men, [Believe and you ſhall live.]</hi> Here is my <hi>R.</hi> Brother's Argument, but I heartily wiſh for his own Credit. he had ſuppreſſed it, and never ſuffered it to ſee the light: For I think, ſuch a ridiculous weak Argument is not to be met with in any learned Author; and to make the weakneſs of it appear, I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, (1.) That his Suppoſition from whence he infers his Poſition, is not true, if it be underſtood of the Moral-Natural-Law only, <hi>materially</hi> conſidered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God put it into the <hi>form of a Covenant,</hi> by adding to it the conditional Promiſe, <hi>If ye do this, ye ſhall live.</hi> In that caſe, by giving unto Man the Precepts of the Moral Natural Law, without the Promiſe of Life. God had ſaid unto him, <hi>[Do this, which thoſe Precepts require;]</hi> but he had not ſaid unto him, <hi>[Thou ſhalt live if thou do this.]</hi> My <hi>R.</hi> Brother may remember, that he himſelf, in Pag. 50. affirms, <hi>That Adam, as ſoon as he had Exiſtence, was preſently bound to Obey God in all that he would Command him, though he had made no Promiſe to him of any Reward:</hi> And if <hi>Adam</hi> was bound to obey God in all that he would Command him, then cerrainly he was bound to obey him in all that he <hi>did</hi> Command him, though he had made no Promiſe to him of any Reward. But I hope Mr. <hi>G.</hi> will not ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> was bound alſo to believe actually that he ſhould live for any determinate time, without a conditional Promiſe of Life to him, if he continued in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For if God would, he might have Annihilated <hi>Adam</hi> again, even after he had been perfectly Obedient for a time, and before he had committed any the leaſt Sin. I ſay, God might have done this by his Abſolute Soveraignty, if he had not engaged himſelf not to do it, by the Promiſe of Life to <hi>Adam.</hi> For God's giving of Life, with the Precepts of the Natural Law to <hi>Adam,</hi> did not of it ſelf without the Promiſe of Life, neceſſarily oblige him not to Annihilate him: Before and without the Promiſe of Life, God by his Abſolute Power and Soveraign Free-Will, might have Annihilated or not Annihilated <hi>Adam.</hi> And therefore in giving the Moral Law to <hi>Adam,</hi> without the Premiſe of Life, God did not ſay to him, <hi>[Do this and thou ſhalt live:]</hi> He ſaid indeed to him, <hi>[Do this,]</hi> but he did not thereby ſay to him, <hi>[Thou ſhalt live if thou do this.]</hi> And without God's ſaying to him by Promiſe, <hi>[Thou ſhalt live if thou do this.] Adam</hi> could have no Infallible Aſſurance that God would not uſe his Power and Soveraign Free-Will in Annihilating him: He could not by all that God had done for him, (in Creating him, and Concreating in him, the Principles and Precepts of the Law of Nature) have any Infallible Aſſurance that he would continue to him the happy Life he had given him and that he would afterwards prefer him to a better, that is, to an Heavenly and Eternal Life. The doing of this depended on God's Free-Will, and therefore <hi>Adam</hi>'s Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93175:68"/>that it ſhould be done, depended upon the Revelation of God's Will, and the Promiſe of God to Man, <hi>That if he never Sinned, he ſhould never Die, but live happily ſorever.</hi> And this was not only poſſible, but it ſeems to have been ſo <hi>De facto:</hi> For in Creating Man after his own Image, God gave him the Principles and Precepts of the Moral Law; but it can never be proved, that God gave him the Promiſe of Life, till ſome time after that he ſaid unto him, as it is written, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>In the day that thou cateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> In which words, the contrary promiſe is implied. But,</p>
               <p n="2">(2dly,) If Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſay, That by God's giving unto man the moral Law, he means, God's giving him the moral Law formally, as a Covenant with its federal Sanction of Threatning and Promiſe; then indeed I grant, That by giving unto <hi>Adam</hi> the moral Law as a <hi>federal Law,</hi> God ſaid unto him, <hi>[Do this, and thou ſhalt live; but if thou do it not, thou ſhalt die.]</hi> But then, tho God ſaid this to <hi>Adam,</hi> by giving him that <hi>federal Law,</hi> yet it is not <hi>ſo clear,</hi> that he ſaith the ſame thing at this day to all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, even to the moſt barbarous Heathens, by giving unto them the moral natural Law. I do grant, That to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the humane Nature, God gives the firſt Principles and Precepts of the moral natural Law unto all mankind that have the uſe of Reaſon, even to the moſt Barbarous Heathens; yea, that he gives alſo the Principles of the Natural Law to their Infants: I ſay, he gives them in <hi>Power,</hi> but not in <hi>Act:</hi> but that God gives unto every one of the moſt barbarous Nations <hi>the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> which he gave at firſt unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and that he ſays unto every one of them, <hi>[Do this, and thou ſhalt live.]</hi> Keep the Precepts of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thou ſhalt live Eternally: Let him prove this at his leiſure. It will not ſuffice to ſay that God virtually and conſtructively made the ſaid promiſe to every one of them, as they were ſeminally and federally in <hi>Adam;</hi> for tho that be very true, and we know it by the written word, or we ſhould never have known it in an ordinary way; yet it is nothing to our preſent purpoſe. For now all the queſtion is about the truth of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. words which ſuppoſe, that <hi>God in giving his Moral Law to all reaſonable</hi> Creatures, ſaid Univerſally to Men <hi>[do this,</hi> and you <hi>ſhall Live.]</hi> Now did God ever ſay this Univerſally to all mankind, even to the moſt Barbarous Nations? And doth he ſay ſo at this day? And doth he ſay it ſo clearly, as that they can underſtand that promiſe of Life, and are bound to believe it without a Supernatural Revelation? Let my Reverend Brother prove this, and I am ſatisfied, as to that matter. But (2.) I Anſwer, that his poſition which he infers from the foreſaid ſuppoſition, (to wit that, ergo, <hi>God in giving the Goſpel Law</hi> to ſome Men] <hi>ſpeaks gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to all Men,</hi> [without exception of the moſt Barbarous Heathens], <hi>believe and you ſhall Live;</hi>) Is not only notoriouſly falſe as conſidered abſolutely in it ſelf; but likewiſe if it be conſidered relatively, as having reſpect unto and as inferred from the ſaid ſuppoſition, it is ſo viſibly Inconſequential and Illogical, that I admire my <hi>R.</hi> Brother did not perceive it. For what Man of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meaſure of Learning, is ſo void of reaſon as deliberately to think and ſay that becauſe the Moral Law (which as to its principles and precepts is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and by nature's light known to all, even to the Heathens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15.) Is ſufficiently promulgated to all mankind even to the moſt Barbarous Nations; <hi>Therefore by parity of reaſon,</hi> the poſitive Goſpel-Law of Grace <hi>[Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt Crucified, and thou ſhalt Live,]</hi> Which is ſupernatural, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be known but by Supernatural Revelation (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.) Is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſufficiently promulgated to all mankind without exception, even to the moſt Barbarous Nations, who have not, and who never had that Supernatural
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93175:68"/>Revelation by which alone it can be known? For my part I cannot but think that that Man is forſaken of common ſenſe and reaſon, who deliberately and ſeriouſly thinks and ſays that there is a parity of reaſon between the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the foreſaid <hi>two Laws of nature, and of Grace,</hi> and that becauſe the one to wit, <hi>the Law of nature,</hi> is and muſt be ſufficiently promulgated to all Men, without exception; therefore the other, to wit, <hi>the Supernatural Law of Grace,</hi> is and muſt be likewiſe ſufflciently promulgated to all Men without exception, even to the moſt Barbarous Nations who never had the foreſaid Supernatural Revelation by which alone it can be known. And ſince it is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably evident, that there is no parity of reaſon between the two caſes, and that there is no Conſequential arguing from the Univerſal promulgation of the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law,</hi> to prove the Univerſal promulgation of the Supernatural Law of Grace; Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may be aſhamed, to aſſirm that the <hi>Two amazing abſurdities which he mentions, will naturally Spring from hence.</hi> For it is plainly ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſay (as he doth) that <hi>they both naturally Spring from his foreſaid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or that they <hi>naturally Spring from God's ſpeaking</hi> generally to all Men <hi>[believe and you ſhall Live].</hi> Now that this may clearly appear, I will ſet down my <hi>R.</hi> Brother's own words, pag. 57. l. 9.10, &amp;c. <hi>[From this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>two amazing abſurdities will naturally Spring; the one is, that God ſhould by this his new Law promiſe pardon and Life, on condition they believe on his Son, to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who never heard that there is ſuch a thing as the Chriſtian Religion in the world, nor ſuch a perſon as Christ, and to whoſe Ears not ſo much as the ſound of his Name, ever arrived.</hi>] Theſe are his own expreſs words, and in them is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the firſt amazing abſurdity. And I ingenuouſly confeſs with my mouth, what I believe in my heart, that what he ſpeaks of, is an amazing abſurdity, to wit, that <hi>God ſhould promiſe pardon and life, on condition of Faith in Chriſt, to people who never heard of Chriſt at all,</hi> i. e. To whom Chriſt was never ſupernaturally revealed at all. But with all I muſt ſay that I am ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to find Mr. <hi>G.</hi> affirming that the ſaid amazing abſurdity doth <hi>naturally Spring from this,</hi> That <hi>God</hi> by the Goſpel or Law of Grace, <hi>ſpeaks generally to all Men believe and you ſhall live.</hi> And if he will prove what he here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, he will amaze me yet more; The thing then he hath to prove is that which he affirms, to wit, That <hi>from God's ſpeaking generally (upon ſuppoſition that he doth ſpeak generally) by the Goſpel-new-Law to all Men, [believe and you ſhall live.] There will naturally Spring, this Conſequence, that God by the ſaid Goſpel-new-Law, promiſes life on condition of believing in Chriſt, to people who never heard of Chriſt and Christian Religion.</hi> That is, in fewer words but of the ſame ſenſe and meaning, <hi>From God's ſpeaking generally by the Goſpel to all Men in the world, concerning Faith in Chriſt, and Life through him; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows naturally that God doth not by the Goſpel ſpeak generally to all Men in the world concerning Faith in Chriſt and Life through him.</hi> I do my <hi>R. B.</hi> no wrong by fixing upon him a conſequence of my feigning. I do abhor to do ſuch a thing, aſſuredly it is not of my feigning, but it was framed in his own head, and is Printed with his Name prefixed to it. I appeal to his own words for the truth of this. Now if this be not an amazing abſurdity, let him prove the truth of the Conſequence: And then we ſhall be all amazed at his Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as of one who can Conjure <hi>quiàlibet ex quolibet,</hi> and Demonſtrate by a natural Conſequence that becauſe God hath generally promulgated the Goſpel to all Men, therefore he hath not generally promulgated the Coſpel to all Men. But Reverend Sir, I hope, upon ſecond thoughts you will ſee how you run your ſelf into the Briers, by miſrepreſenting the truth, and by indeavouring,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93175:69"/>to render it odious to your ignorant followers: And I wiſh you may be ſo ingenuous as to confeſs (for the undeceiving of the people) that our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are not ſuch as ſome take them to be, and that no ſuch abſurdity as is pretended, doth naturally Spring from them. For my part I never ſaid nor thought that God, by the Goſpel, <hi>Speaks generally to all Men without exception, believe and you ſhall live;</hi> I publiſhed the contrary to the world in that very book, which this brother now writes againſt. See <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 200. But if I were of that Opinion, I ſhould from it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the quite contrary to that which you infer, and ſhould ſay. <hi>[Now from this Opinion</hi> (if it be true) <hi>there will naturally ſpring this other Truth, that all Men generally without exception, have heard the Goſpel, and that there is ſuch a Perſon as Chriſt, and ſuch a Religion as that called Chriſtian.]</hi> In ſhort you know well enough that in my Judgment, <hi>God hath not Promulgated the Goſpel to all Men in the World, even to the most barbarous Nations, by ſpeaking univerſally to them all, and ſaying, that if they do all Believe in Christ they ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And that therefore many are invincibly and inculpably ignorant of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, becauſe God hath no ways Revealed Chriſt and his Goſpel to them unto this day; nor doth he either by Precept Command them, or by Promiſe Encourage them, to Believe in Chriſt. This is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Negative Infidelity,</hi> which is no Sin in the Barbarous Nations, which are moſt invincibly ignorant of Chriſt, and are under no obligation to Believe in him, becauſe the Goſpel-Law or Covenant of Grace, which can only be known by Supernatural Revelation, is not at all Revealed and made known to them; but they are guilty of groſs Idolatry, and other enormous Sins againſt the Light and Law of Nature, for which they are juſtly Condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>And this ſhews that my <hi>R.</hi> Brothers ſecond amazing abſurdity, doth not concern me; for whether it do, or do not <hi>naturally ſpring from God's ſpeaking generally to all Men,</hi> without exception, and ſaying, <hi>Believe in Chriſt and you ſhall Live;</hi> It doth not touch me, and the Cauſe which I maintain, for theſe two plain Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I do utterly deny the Antecedent, from which it is ſaid naturally to ſpring. I deny that God by the Goſpel ſpeaks generally to all the Men in the World without exception of the moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, and Commands them all to Believe in Chriſt, with a Promiſe of Life, if they do Believe in him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the conſequent, which is ſaid to ſpring naturally from the ſaid Antecedent, I diſown it alſo, to wit, <hi>That God contrary to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs promiſes Pardon to all Men, upon the impoſſible condition of Believing in Chriſt by their meer Natural Powers.</hi> I am ſo far from ſaying this, that on the contrary, I ſay there may be many Millions of Men in the World, who cannot Believe in Chriſt by their meer Natural Powers, to whom God doth not Promiſe Pardon of Sin upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible condition of Believing in Chriſt by their meer Natural Powers. And hence it plainly appears, that by my Principle <hi>I</hi> am under no obligation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the one hand to join with my <hi>R.</hi> Brother in denying that the Goſpel Covenant, or Law of Grace, hath any Conditional Promiſes; or on the other hand to joyn with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> in affirming that there is an univerſal ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> expreſſes it, That <hi>all Men have ſufficient means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them to Believe in Chriſt, and that God gives help enough to enable them to Believe if they will, and whenever themſelves pleaſe.</hi> I thank God, <hi>I</hi> can by my Principle walk ſafely in the middle way between theſe two Extreams, and not <hi>incidere in Scyllam, cupiens virare Charybdin.</hi> And I think it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to have been more modeſt than to have paſt ſuch a Cenſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93175:69"/>our moſt able and judicious Divines, who have maintained that the Goſpel hath Conditional Promiſes, as that they could not defend the Truth againſt the <hi>Arminians;</hi> but upon their Principle, that the Goſpel hath Conditional Promiſes, they ought all to have turned <hi>Arminians.</hi> For this is in effect, to ſay, That <hi>Whitaker, Ames, Twiſs,</hi> our Britiſh Divines of the Synod of <hi>Dort, Rutherford, Rivet, Spanhem, Turretin, Iſaac Junius, Triglandius, Pool,</hi> and innumerable more, who held, that the Goſpel hath Conditional Promiſes; were all blind and did not ſee the miſchievous Conſequence of their opinions; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence if they had followed, they themſelves muſt all have turned <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> and therefore neither did nor could rightly confute the <hi>Arminian</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; but young Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is the Man that is above them all inlightned to ſee that the Goſpel hath no conditional promiſes, and by that means he is qualified to be our Champion againſt thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> who were too hard for the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> for <hi>Ames, Twiſs, Rutherford, Spanhem, Durham,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe old weak Men were fond of one <hi>Arminian</hi> opinion (to wit, that the Goſpel hath conditional promiſes) which hath an inſeperable Connexion with the whole <hi>Arminian</hi> Syſtem.</p>
               <p>Diſc. pag. 58. <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Thirdly, he argues thus againſt the Goſpel's having conditional promiſes. <hi>The Scriptures urged by my Reverend Brother, do not ſignify that God paſſed his word to all Men, by a new Law establiſhed amongſt them, that if they obey it, and believe and repent, they ſhall aſſuredly be ſaved: For God always ſpeaks the purpoſes of his mind and none of his words contradict his heart, but he never decreed, either abſolutely or conditionally, that all Men ſhould be Eternally ſaved.</hi> I Anſwer, that my <hi>R.</hi> Brother's objection as here ſet down in his own expreſs words, doth not at all reach me, nor make againſt the truth which I defend. For I never ſaid that God hath paſſed his word to <hi>all Men,</hi> by a <hi>new Law eſtabliſhed amongst them,</hi> that if they obey it, and believe and repent, they ſhall aſſuredly be ſaved. I am ſo far from ſaying this, that in effect I have plainly ſaid the contrary in the <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 200. l. 21.22, 23, 24, 25. There my expreſs formal words are that there <hi>are Heathens who never heard, nor could hear of the Goſpel for want of an objective Revelation of it.</hi> Now by theſe words I certainly meant, and do ſtill mean to ſignify to the world, that God hath not paſſed his word <hi>to all Men,</hi> even to the moſt Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations, <hi>by a new Law of Grace,</hi> i. e. <hi>by the Goſpel eſtabliſhed among them,</hi> That if they obey the Goſpel and believe in Chriſt, they ſhall aſſuredly be ſaved. This objection then I might diſmiſs as impertinent and not militating againſt me, who am not ſuch an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliſt</hi> as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> would make people believe that I am, tho I have declared the contrary; and any body would think that I ſhould know mine own mind better than another Man, eſpecially Man who knows not my principles but by my book; unleſs he ſuffers himſelf to be impoſed upon by believing the falſe reports of his <hi>good Friend.</hi> I hope that for the future my <hi>R. B.</hi> will be ſo juſt, as to take the meaſure of my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from my Printed Books, and not from the reports of the <hi>Accuſer.</hi> But it may be, my <hi>R.</hi> brother will ſay that tho I be no ſuch an Univerſaliſt, yet it is certain that I hold that the Goſpel hath conditional promiſes, and that the conditional promiſes are to the whole viſible Church, even to the non-elect to whom the Goſpel is Preached. To which I ſay again, that it is true and moſt certain that ſuch is my Judgment, and I am not ſingular in it, for as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Apology, it is the Common Doctrine of the reformed Churches and Divines. Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſaith, <hi>[If the former ſenſe be intended (as how can it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93175:70"/>be denied)? The word of the Covenant is Preached to you, an offer of Chriſt is made in the Preached Goſpel to you.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Covenant of Life opened. part. 1. Chap. 13. pag. 87.88.</note> Then it cannot be denied, but the promiſe is to all the Reprobate in the viſible Church, whether they believe or not, for Christ is Preached, and promiſes of the Covenant are Preached to</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>to</hi> Judas <hi>and all the Hypocrites who ſtumble at the word, to all the Phariſees, as is clear,</hi> Mat. 13.20, 21, 22, 23. Act. 13.44, 45, 46. Act. 18.5, 6. Mat. 21.43. 1 Pet. 2.7, 8.] And again, a little after in the ſame book, pag. 90. he ſaith that <hi>[promiſes are as properly made to profeſſors within the viſible Church,</hi> Act. 2.39. <hi>As Commands, and threatnings, exhortations, invitations, and Goſpel-requests are made to them. But tho the Anabaptiſts ignorantly confound the promiſe and the thing promiſed; the Covenant, and Benefits Covenanted: The promiſe is to you, and ſo are the commands and threatnings, whether ye believe or not,</hi> &amp;c.] And pag. 94. of the ſame book, his formal expreſs words are as followeth. <hi>[It is not inconvenient that the reprobate in the viſible Church, be ſo under the Covenant of Grace, as ſome promiſes are made to them, and ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies promiſed to them conditionally, and ſome reſerved ſpecial promiſes of a new beart, and of perſeverance belong not to them. For all the promiſes belong not the ſame way, to the parties viſibly, and externally, and to the parties internally and perſonally in Covenant with God. So the Lord promiſeth Life and Forgiveneſs ſhall be given to theſe who are Externally in the Covenant, providing they believe, but the Lord promiſeth not a new heart and grace to believe, to theſe that are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Externally in Covenant. And he promiſeth both to the Elect.</hi>] Thus Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford. Zanchy</hi> whom my <hi>R.</hi> brother doth highly Commend, was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſame Judgment, witneſs his own expreſs words.
<note n="†" place="bottom">Reſpondeo deum vocare etiam reprobos, et mandare ut ad ſe veniant, Salutemque illis promittere, ſi velint in Chriſtum credere, manifeſtum eſt, omnes enim vocat per ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, et omnibus vitam promittit aeternam, modo in Chriſtum velint credere atque haec eſt voluntas conditionalis.—reprobos vero non illudi, cum a domino vocantur, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtum tiam oſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Zanch. depulſ. calumn. de predeſt. not. 16.

               <p>Having thus frankly and faithfully declared my Judgment in this matter, and ſhewed it not to be ſingular; I will now for the further clearing up of the truth, perſonate my <hi>R.</hi> brother, and for him argue againſt my ſelf, and then Anſwer the Arguments. <hi>Obj.</hi> God did not decree to ſave all Men, even the non-elect in the viſible Church, therefore he doth not promiſe ſalvation <hi>to any upon</hi> condition of Faith in Chriſt. The reaſon of the Conſequence is, becauſe every conditional promiſe of God's word, preſuppoſes an anſwerable decree and purpoſe of God's will, for God always ſpeaks the purpoſes of his mind, and none of his words contradict his heart. I Anſwer, (1.) By deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conſequence, for tho God did not decree to ſave all even the non-elect in the viſible Church, yet he promiſeth to ſave ſome, even all the elect in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93175:70"/>viſible Church, on condition of Faith in Chriſt: For he hath decreed to ſave them all, he hath abſolutely decreed their ſalvation on condition of Faith in Chriſt. The decree of their ſalvation is abſolute in reſpect of God decreeing. but the object of the decree is conditional in reſpect of the ſalvation decreed, That is, God by his abſolute will hath made faith the condition of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hath ſuſpended the giving of ſalvation unto them upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their believing, or till they perform the condition of believing in Chriſt. (2.) I Anſwer, by denying the Conſequence alſo with reſpect to the non-elect, for tho God did not decree to ſave the non-elect in the viſible Church, as he decreed to ſave the elect; yet he promiſeth to ſave the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elect in the viſible Church, conditionally, that is, provided that they believe in Chriſt, as they are commanded to do. And to the reaſon of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that every conditional promiſe of God's word preſuppoſeth an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable decree of God's will, becauſe none of God's words contradict his will. I Anſwer that in this caſe, the decree of God's will which Anſwers the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſe to the non-elect, is not a decree of Gods will to ſave the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elect, as he hath decreed to ſave the elect; but it is the decree to make the conditional promiſe of ſalvation to the non-elect in the viſible Church. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God doth in time, that he decreed to do from Eternity. But in time he promiſeth ſalvation conditionally to the non-elect in the viſible Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from Eternity he decreed to promiſe them ſalvation on condition that they believe in Chriſt. We muſt diſtinguiſh between God's decretory will ſtrictly ſo called as it hath reſpect to the infallible ſalvation of the elect; and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory will, as it hath reſpect to the conditional promiſe of ſalvation to all, elect and non-elect in the viſible Church, conſtituting a conditional connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between ſalvation as the benefit promiſed, and faith in Chriſt as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required of all. Now to apply this diſtinction, every conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God's word, doth not neceſſarily preſuppoſe the foreſaid decretory will, but it ſufficeth unto the verification of the conditional promiſe of ſalvation, as ſuch; that there be in God the foreſaid promiſſory will, conſtituting a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional connexion between ſalvation, as the benefit promiſed, and Faith in Chriſt, as the condition required. The conditional promiſe it ſelf, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly God's will, but it is a ſign of his promiſſory will. And it is certain that the promiſe of God's word, is a true ſign of his will, but in this caſe, it is not a true ſign of his foreſaid decretory will; therefore it muſt be a true ſign of his promiſſory will, and it gives us an infallible aſſurance, that there is a conditional connexion between ſalvation as the benefit promiſed, and Faith in Chriſt as the condition required of all, ſo that whoſoever performeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he ſhall have the benefit promiſed, whoſoever believeth in Chriſt, ſhall certainly be ſaved. And therefore it may be truly ſaid to ſuch an one as <hi>Cain,</hi> if thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. And the Spirit by the word ſaith to every Man in the viſible Church, that reads and underſtands the 10th of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart, that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. (3.) Thirdly, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> muſt admit of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as good and ſatisfactory, or he muſt find out a better; for the objection is certainly ſophiſtical, and he is as much concerned to Anſwer it, as I am. And I doubt not to make him confeſs that it is ſo, that it is a meer Sophiſm, or elſe to make <hi>him eat his own words.</hi> For mark, I pray, that in his diſcourſe of the Goſpel, he ſays, pag. 57. lin. 6.7, 8. (1.) <hi>That God in giving his Moral Law to all reaſonable Creatures, ſaid univerſally to Men, do this, and you ſhall
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93175:71"/>Live.</hi> (2.) He muſt own that, <hi>do this, and you ſhall live,</hi> or, <hi>if you do this you ſhall live,</hi> is a conditional promiſe of the Law, or Covenant of works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a little before in the ſame book and Chapter, he ſays, pag. 56. lin. 18.19. That <hi>[The promiſes of the Law were made to Men, on condition that its precepts were obeyed,]</hi> Theſe are his own expreſs words. From which two paſſages it manifeſtly appears, that according to his Judgment God's Law or Covenant of works, had a conditional promiſe of Life. Life was promiſed in the Law and Covenant of works, to <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they perſonally, perpetually and perfectly kept its precepts. This is Mr. G'<hi>s</hi> own Doctrine which he hath publiſhed to the world. Now let his Argument againſt conditional promiſes of the Goſpel, be applied to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſes of the Law, and it will as ſtrongly and effectually diſprove all conditional promiſes of the Law, which he owns; as it will diſprove all conditſonal promiſes of the Goſpel, which he denies. Thus then I form the Argument and turn it againſt Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf, and the conditional promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Law, which he maintains. (God did not, either abſolutely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally decree to give Life, Eternal Life to <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of his poſterity, by the Law, and Covenant of works, or on condition of keeping the Law and Covenant of works; for if he had ſo decreed it, he would have taken effectual care that <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity ſhould never have died, but ſhould have had Eternal Life on that condition, and by keeping that Law and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; ſince the intents of his mind and will always obtain infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly their deſir'd effect. Therefore God never promiſed Life to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity on condition of their keeping the Law and Covenant of works. The reaſon of the Conſequence is, becauſe God always ſpeaks the purpoſes of his mind, and none of his words contradict his heart: Or (which is the ſame thing) becauſe every conditional promiſe of God's word, preſuppoſes an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable decree and purpoſe of God's will. Here is his own Argument turned againſt himſelf, and thereby the conditional promiſe of the Law, which he maintains; is as ſtrongly and effectually diſproved, as is the conditional promiſe of the Goſpel, which we defend. It is plain then that ſince his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument militates as ſtrongly againſt himſelf, as againſt us, he is as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to Anſwer it, as we are. And if he can Anſwer it, as it militates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, he can by the ſame means Anſwer it as it militates againſt us. One Anſwer will ſerve us both. If therefore he do not like our Anſwer, let him find out a better. And it will ſerve our turn as well as his. I hope this may be a means to open his eyes and to convince him that his Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the conditional promiſes of the Goſpel, is a putid Sophiſm. For it is a certain evidence that an Argument is Sophiſtical and proves nothing; when if it prove any thing, it proves too much; even more than we would have it to prove, or than we can with a ſafe Conſcience admit.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for an Anſwer to the foreſaid objection. But for clearing the truth and for our edification, I will urge an other Argument which ſeems to have more ſtrength than the former.</p>

                  </gap>elect who hear the glad tydings of the Goſpel, upon condition of Faith and Repentance; will it not hence clearly follow, that there is a <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional will in God,</hi> that God's will depends on ſomething without it ſelf, in the Creature, and that it hangs in ſuſpence untill the condition be performed, or not performed. The reaſon of the Conſequence is becauſe every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93175:71"/>Promiſe ſignifies and teſtifies that the Promiſer doth will and purpoſe to give the Benefit promiſed, if the Condition required be performed; otherwiſe the Promiſe would be falſe, deceitful, and deluſive, which the Promiſe of the God of Truth cannot poſſibly be. But there cannot be a Conditional Will in God, nor can his Will depend upon any thing, nor hang in ſuſpence at all; Therefore it ſeems God cannot make any conditional Promiſe unto the Non-Elect, who hear the glad Tidings of the Goſpel, that they ſhall be Pardoned and Saved if they Believe and Repent. This is the Argument, whereunto I Anſwer, (1.) That whoever looks narrowly into this Argument, may eaſily and plainly ſee, that it muſt needs be Sophiſtical and Fallacious, becauſe (as was ſaid before) either it proves nothing, or it proves too muth, to wit, that God <hi>could not,</hi> in the firſt Covenant or Law of Works, promiſe the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Life unto <hi>Adam</hi> (and in him to his Poſterity) in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, upon Condition of Perſonal, perfect, and ever Sinleſs Obedience. But that is certainly falſe; and contrary to the Judgment of all Divines, even of Mr. G. himſelf, for they all hold, as well as I, that the firſt Covenant was Conditional, and that God, before the Fall, promiſed unto <hi>Adam</hi> Immunity from Death, and Eternal Life, on condition of perfect and ever Sinleſs Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. We are then all alike concerned to anſwer the aforeſaid Sophiſm taken from the Inconditionality and Independen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of God's Will. (2.) I Anſwer, That it is great weakneſs, and a degree of Infidelity, to disbelieve and deny that which God hath clearly Revealed in his Holy Word, becauſe do not clearly perceive the <hi>way and manner, how God</hi> Wills one thing to be, upon condition of another thing's being. What though we ſhould never know the <hi>way and manner,</hi> how God conditionally Wills the things which he hath Conditionally Promiſed? Is it a wiſe courſe (think ye) to disbelieve and deny the Being of Conditional Promiſes, and God's willing the things Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed conditionally, (both which he hath clearly Revealed) becauſe he hath not Revealed, and <hi>therefore we do not know the way and manner of his willing things conditionally?</hi> It were eaſily to prove, that to disbelieve and deny things clearly Revealed, becauſe we do not clearly underſtand God's <hi>(modus volendi) way and manner of willing,</hi> which is not Revealed, is the ready way to make all the world turn Infidels or Deiſts: To prevent which, let us all follow the Wiſe Counſel of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which he gives in theſe following Words.

                  <hi>I often in my Writings put Men in mind, that nothing here is better than a learned Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; becauſe they rave like Mad-Men, who adventure, or take upon them to be more wiſe, and to know more than is meet: Now thou ſeeſt how that Will of God, to which the Scriptures bear Teſtimony, is certainly known to me; and yet the ſame Will is ſecret and hid from me; becauſe the underſtanding of the very Angels doth not fully know and comprehend,</hi> why <hi>God Wills this or that to be, and</hi> how <hi>he Wills it.</hi>] By which Words <hi>Calvin</hi> gives us to underſtand, that if we would act like reaſonable Men, we ſhould firmly Believe whatever God hath in the Scriptures <hi>Revealed to be,</hi> although we do not underſtand <hi>the way and manner of his willing it to be.</hi> But now if you ſay, doth it appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that God hath Revealed in the Scriptures, that he hath made Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſes to all in the viſible Church? I anſwer, Yes, It doth appear
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93175:72"/>very plainly, as hath been ſhewed already. For, (1.) To all in the viſible Church, who hear the Goſpel Preached, the Conditional Promiſes are general without exception; witneſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. and <hi>John</hi> 6.40. Theſe Conditional Promiſes could not be more generally and univerſally expreſſed, and therefore they belong to all Men that hear them, upon the ſame condition of Faith, and Calling upon the Name of the Lord. Accordingly, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her 17th Article, (which we have all ſubſcribed) ſaith, that as a Remedy againſt the Abuſe of the Doctrine of Predeſtination, and to prevent Deſperation, <hi>We muſt receive God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in ſuch Wiſe, as they be generally ſet forth in Holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Holy Spirit, in the Sacred Scripture, applies the general Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promiſe, <hi>to every one in particular,</hi> and ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This every one who hears the Goſpel Preached is bound to Believe, and therefore he is bound to apply it Conditionally to himſelf, and to ſay in his Heart, if I then ſhall ſo confeſs and Believe, I ſhall be Saved: And if he do not do this, he in effect gives the Spirit of God the Lye; whence it neceſſarily follows, that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Salvation Conditionally unto all that hear the Goſpel, whoever they be, whether they be Elect, or Non-Elect.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Cain</hi> was one of the Non-Elect, and God certainly knew him to be ſuch; yet God made a Conditional Promiſe of Acceptance unto him. The Lord God with his own Bleſſed Mouth, immediately ſaid unto <hi>Cain</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>If thou doſt well, Shalt thou not be accepted? Gen.</hi> 4.7. That Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <hi>Shalt thou not be accepted?</hi> is equivalent to an Affirmation, and it is, as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>Cain,</hi> Thou ſhalt certainly be accepted, if thou doſt well. See <hi>Onkelo</hi>'s Chaldee Paraphraſe, with <hi>P. Fagius</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Command to Believe on Chriſt, belongs without exception to all in the viſible Church, unto whom the Goſpel is Preached; therefore the Conditional Promiſe of Pardon and Salvation, which is annexed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, belongs likewiſe unto all without exception: Becauſe the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſe is therefore annexed to the Command, that by the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, all may be induced to Obey the Command.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) The Conditional Threatning (<hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24.) annexed to the Command, belongs to all without exception; therefore ſo doth the Conditional Promiſe; becauſe there is the like reaſon for the one, as for the other. If the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Threatning belong to all, to deter them from Unbelief; the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Promiſe belongs unto all, to perſuade them unto Faith. Thus doth it plainly appear to be Revealed in the Scriptures of Truth, that God hath made Conditional Promiſes to all in the viſible Church. And therefore we ought to believe it, although we do not clearly know <hi>God's (modus volendi,) his way of willing one thing upon condition of another thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Thirdly, I anſwer, That however formidable this Objection may be in ſome Men's Apprehenſions, yet to me it appears to be a Sophiſm, which is capable of an eaſie and fair Solution: And in order to the ſolving of it, <hi>I</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between God's Will conſidered abſolutely, and entitatively in it ſelf, and <hi>as it were</hi> ſubjectively; and conſidered reſpectively, and terminatively unto the things Willed, or conſidered objectively. Now when we conſider God's Will the firſt way, when we conſider God's Will abſolutely in it ſelf, and (if we may ſo ſay) as it is ſubjectively in God, or rather as it is God: It is freely confeſſed, that it is not Conditional, that it doth not depend on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93175:72"/>any thing, nor hang in ſuſpence at all. For God's Will ſo conſidered, is not diſtinct from his Nature, but is really himſelf: And <hi>it is most certain,</hi> that God is not Conditional, that he is not Dependent on any thing, nor doth he at all hang in ſuſpence, as if he were doubtful what to do. But if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſpect which God's Will hath unto the things Willed, and its termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the things Willed; as alſo if we conſider the object of God's Will, or the things Willed, as one part of the intire object, or one of the things Willed, hath a relation unto the other; ſo God's Will may very well be denominated Conditional, that is, God's Will, which in it ſelf, and as it is ſubjectively in God, (or rather to ſpeak properly and ſtrictly the ſame with God) is moſt abſolute, independent, and determinate; may be ſaid to be reſpectively, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively, and objectively Conditional: For this is no more but to ſay, that the reſpect of God's Will unto, and it's termination upon the things Willed, is Conditional; or that the object as it hath reſpect unto God's Will, and as it is the term of God's Will, is Conditional. And this may very well be, and yet God's Will in it ſelf is not Conditional, but moſt abſolute and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. For the reſpect of God's Will unto, and the termination of his Will upon its object; and the object as reſpecting and terminating God's Will, are really diſtinct from his Will. God's Will remains the ſame, abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent in it ſelf, though it be many ſeveral ways related to, and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon its objects; and though ſeveral Denominations be given unto it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account. Let this diſtinction be applied unto the Objection, and the Sophiſtry of it preſently appears. For (1.) from God's promiſing Salvation unto any Elect or Non-Elect, upon condition of Faith, it follows indeed, that God's promiſſory Will is Conditional, to give them Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they Believe, and ſo perform the Condition: But pray conſider, How is it Conditional? Is it conditionally in it ſelf ſubjectively, or rather entitative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, ſo as to be dependent and hang in ſuſpence? No ſuch matter, nor doth any ſuch thing follow from God's making Conditional Promiſes. It is only Conditional, reſpectively, terminatively, and objectively; and that is all which follows from God's making Conditional Promiſes, and willing the things promiſed Conditionally. The Lord our God, with an <hi>abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Will,</hi> doth Will, that if Men truly Believe and Repent, they ſhall be Pardoned and Saved, whoſoever they be; but not Pardoned and Saved if they do not Believe and Repent. (2.) We apply the ſame diſtinction to the minor or ſecond Propoſition of the Objection, and grant that there cannot be a Conditional Will in God, that is, a <hi>Will in it ſelf and ſubjectively, or enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively</hi> Conditional, and ſo as to be in it ſelf dependent, and to hang in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: But then we utterly deny that the Will of God, which is abſolute, independent, and determinate it it ſelf, cannot be reſpectively, terminatively, and objectively Conditional in the Sence before explained. This diſtinction was approved and uſed by Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> (as I ſhewed in the Apology, p. 105, 106.) and by our Brittiſh Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as from their Collegiate Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, I proved in the Apology, p. 114. So did Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> approve it; witneſs what he writes againſt <hi>Corvinus.</hi> His words are, [

                  <hi>For neither do we deny but that the Decrees of God may be called Conditional, in reſpect of the things Willed; to wit, as neither eternal Life is to be given but upon Condition of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.]
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93175:73"/>The like he hath in his Engliſh Books, both againſt <hi>Hoard</hi> and other Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and alſo againſt Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi> And as this diſtinction is approved by thoſe great Divines, ſo is it by all other Learned Men, that I know, who rightly underſtand theſe Matters. See <hi>Ainſworth</hi>'s Cenſure upon the Anabaptiſts Dialogue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 10. where he ſaith, [<hi>God's Will always lays no ſuch neceſſity; ſeeing he Willeth ſome things Conditionally, which are not effected unleſs the Condition be obſerved: as he would a Sinner's Life, not Death, Conditionally if he return to God, he would the deſtruction of</hi> Niniveh; <hi>but Conditionally, except they Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; other things God Willeth abſolutely, and thoſe muſt needs come to paſs: For none reſiſt, or hinder his abſolute Will,</hi> Iſa. 46.10, 11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 5. p. 58. Fifthly, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> objects, That if the Conditional Promiſe be to all in the viſible Church, that if they Believe they ſhall be Saved, then by the ſame rule we muſt ſay, That the Conditional Threatning is to all, that if they Believe not, they ſhall be Eternally Damned. I Anſwer. And what Abſurdity is in this, that all in the viſible Church, who do not yet Believe, are Threatned with Eternal Damnation, if they live and die in Unbelief. For underſtand the Conditional Threatning in the ſame Sence as I have ſhewed the Conditional Promiſe ought to be underſtood; and it is a certain Truth, That as the Conditional Promiſe is to all, in the ſame Sence the Conditional Threatning is to all in general, and to every one in particular, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. and 8.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſays no, The Conditional Threatning is not to all, nor yet to any, if they do not Believe: And I pray, why ſo? To this he ſays, That the Reaſon why none are Threatned with Death if they do not Believe, is, becauſe the Threatning is not denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Men for not Believing in Chriſt, but for not perfectly obeying the Law of Works, as he hath proved before. VVhereunto I reply, that I have alſo anſwered him before, and have proved the contrary. And here I muſt adviſe him to take better heed what he writes for the future, and not to contradict the Scripture in expreſs terms. The Holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith, No, it is not ſo, But he that Believeth not, is Condemned, becauſe he hath not perfectly obeyed the Law of VVorks. Now chooſe you, Whether you will Believe the Scripture contradicting him, or Believe him contradicting the Scripture.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. Sixthly, Out of what he writes in Pag. 57. this Argument may be formed againſt God's making Conditional Promiſes to the Non-Elect in the viſible Church. If God promiſe them Pardon, on Condition that they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by their meer Natural Powers, deprived as they are, without his All-Conquering Grace, he acts in a way Repugnant to his Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for he knows it to be impoſſible for them to Believe by their meer Natural Powers, without his All-Conquering Grace; and to Promiſe them Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon ſuch a Condition, as he knows to be impoſſible for them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, would be an illuding and mocking of them.

                  </gap>uſt ſo, if God ſhould Promiſe Pardon to the Non-Elect in the viſible Church,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93175:73"/>on Condition that they Believe by their meer Natural Powers, which they cannot do; and ſhould withall refuſe to put forth his Finger to help them; he ſhould but mock them, and make a ſport of their Miſery, which to do, is repugnant to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs: And therefore God by the Goſpel makes no Conditional Promiſe to the non-elect in the viſible Church. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this objection ſhews that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is better at declairning, than at fair arguing and cloſe reaſoning; and ſeems to intimate him to be of the Man's mind who ſaid <hi>flectere ſi nequeo ſuperos, Acheronta movebo.</hi> For this Argument (if it may be called an Argument) is fetched from Hell, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Devil, that is, from the <hi>Arminians</hi> who (if Mr. <hi>G.</hi> have not wronged them in his Epiſtle to the Reader) muſt needs be Incarnate Devils. For he ſays (<hi>Their opinions tear the Volume of Gods word to pieces, and un-God God himſelf: They pull him out of his Throne, and ſtrike the Scepter out of his Hands, and ſnatch the Crown from his Head.</hi> This is certainly more than all the Devils in Hell can do; but if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſay true and do not ſlander the <hi>Arminians,</hi> they have done it; they have un-Godded God himſelf. And yet for all this, he goes down to that <hi>Arminian</hi> Hell, to borrow an Argument from thoſe worſt of Devils to defend and ſecure the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of the God of Heaven, from being impeached by the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine of conditional promiſes in the Goſpel-Covenant. But now let me ask this <hi>R. B.</hi> a few queſtions as (1.) Is it not now every whit as impoſſible (if not more impoſſible) for the non-elect in the viſible Church to keep the Law of works moſt perfectly, as to believe in Chriſt ſincerely? (2.) Doth not Mr. <hi>G.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hold that notwithſtanding the ſaid impoſſibility, God now requires of them perfect obedience to the Law of works, under pain of Eternal Death and Miſery? (3.) Doth he not hold alſo that God by the Law and Covenant of works doth promiſe them Life and Happineſs upon condition that they moſt perfectly obey that Law and keep that Covenant of Works. This I take to be his Judgment from what he writes in Chap. 7. pag. 56. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with what he quotes with approbation out of Melancton in Chap. 6. pag. 29.30. Concerning the promiſes of the Law, as contra-diſtinguiſhed from the gracious promiſes of the Goſpel. Now if this be ſo, that according to Mr. G. Godpromiſeth to the non-elect by the Law and Covenant of works, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5.) That they ſhall have, (Not indeed pardon of ſin and ſalvation properly ſo called, but) Life and Happineſs on condition, that they moſt perfectly keep the Law and Covenant of works. I ſay if this be Mr. G'<hi>s.</hi> Judgment, I demand. (4.) Whether it be not as evidently repugnant to the wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, and as plainly a mocking of thoſe wretched Men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them Eternal Life and Happineſs by the Covenant of works upon the impoſſible condition that they moſt perfectly fulfill the Law of works; As it is to promiſe them pardon and ſalvation by the Goſpel or Covenant of Grace, on the impoſſible condition of believing in Chriſt. So that my <hi>R. B.</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument militates againſt himſelf and he is as much bound to Anſwer it, as we are: Unleſs he deny the conditional promiſes of the Law, as he doth thoſe of the Goſpel; and when once I know that he doth deny both, I ſhall ceaſe from retorting his own Argument upon him; and ſhall take another way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him. In the mean time this may ſerve for the firſt Anſwer. (2.) I Anſwer, that <hi>this Arminian</hi> objection was ſufficiently anſwered in the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy out of the writings of the profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and of Dr. <hi>Twiſs.</hi> For there it was ſhewed. (1.) That as for the non-elect to whom the Goſpel is Preached in the viſible Church, God doth not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93175:74"/>require them to believe in Chriſt by their <hi>meer natural powers,</hi> without any help; without his putting forth ſo much as <hi>his finger</hi> to help them: For to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Goſpel-Command to believe they receive more Common-Grace, more light and power from the Lord, than they make a good uſe of; and as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, (<hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 23. and pag. 114.115.) where real Converſion is not attained, <hi>It is always from the Interpoſition of an Act of Wilfulneſs and Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in thoſe enlightened and convicted. They do not ſincerely improve what they have received, and faint not meerly for want of ſtrength to preceed, but by a free Act of their own wills, they refuſe the grace which is further tendred unto them in the Goſpel.</hi> (2.) There it was ſhewed out of the Writings of Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> where he Anſwers this ſame objection which Mr. G. hath <hi>borrowed from the Arminians,</hi> that as for the non-elect in the viſible Church, their inability to believe in Chriſt according to the Goſpel, <hi>is not a meer phyſical impotency,</hi> but it is a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impotency,</hi> Jer. 6.10. Which hath its immediate Foundation in and its next riſe from their own wills; ſo that if they earneſtly would believe, then they could believe; but they cannot believe becauſe they will not. Whereas the inability of the poor wretch of whom Mr. G. ſpeaks, and to whom he compares the unconverted, is not at all a Moral impotency, but it is a meer Phyſical natural impotency. There is nothing in the Man's own will that cauſes him to refuſe wilfully to come up out of the Dungeon, in which he is a ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that which hinders him from coming up, is the natural weakneſs of his Limbs which are all ſuppoſed to be broke; ſo that the poor wounded Man cannot come up out of the Dungeon to receive the Food that is offered him, ſuppoſe he were never ſo earneſtly willing and deſirous to do it. Now Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> ſhews that there is a vaſt difference between theſe two impotencies, between im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency Moral, and impotency meerly Phyſical; that impotency Moral is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly culpable and deſerves to be puniſhed, becauſe it is willful and affected; whereas impotency meerly Phyſical is not culpable at all, but is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable; and that therefore it is a ſhameful thing in the <hi>Arminians</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found theſe two impotencies, to wit Moral and Natural impotency, as if there were no difference. See for this the <hi>Apol.</hi> 109.110. Where the expreſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal words of Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> are quoted at large. If then Mr. <hi>G.</hi> have a mind to diſpute againſt this Diſtinction, I deſire it may be remembred that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes not ſo much againſt me, as againſt Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and in the Doctors Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth a thing which will have <hi>a ſhameful iſſue,</hi> to confound impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency Moral with impotency natural, as he plainly doth.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) I Anſwer that what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſuppoſes to ſtrengthen his <hi>Arminian Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is manifeſtly falſe; to wit that God always Commands the non-elect in the viſible Church to believe by their <hi>Meer natural powers without any help,</hi> ſince he will not ſo much as put forth <hi>his finger to help them.</hi> I ſay this is falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (1.) It is contrary to Scripture, which ſaith, that Gods Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with ſuch Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. According to our Tranſlation, and that plainly implies that for a time God's Spirit doth ſtrive with them; and I ſuppoſe it will not be ſaid that God's Spirit ſtrives with them to hinder them, but rather to help them. So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. The wiſdom of God ſaith to ſuch Men, turn ye at my reproof: Behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, and I will make known my words unto you. Here is not only a Command to <hi>turn unto God,</hi> but a promiſe alſo of <hi>ſome help</hi> to enable them to turn. And then it follows immediately in the 24. verſe, becauſe I have called, and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, <hi>I have ſtretched out my hand,</hi> and no Man regarded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which words the Lord himſelf ſaith, that <hi>he ſtretches out his hand to ſuch Men;</hi> but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93175:74"/>Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaith that the Lord will not ſo much as <hi>put out his finger</hi> to help them; for he compares the Lord in this matter, to a mercileſs Man who offers food to a poor wretch ſtarving in a Dungeon with all his Limbs broken, on condition that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ome up and receive it, and yet he refuſes to put forth a finger to give him the leaſt liſt. Thus Mr. <hi>G.</hi> repreſents God to the world upon the Principles of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> whereas God in the Scriptures of truth repreſents himſelf the quite contrary way, ſaying that he is ſo far from not putting forth his finger, that he <hi>ſtretches out his hand</hi> to ſuch Men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. Yea that he not only ſtretches out one hand, but that he ſtretches out both hands to them. As it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. To <hi>Iſrael</hi> he ſaith, <hi>All day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gain-ſaying People,</hi> See alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. v. 14.15, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. v. 12.13, 22, 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.)

God therefore wills that he who dies ſhould live (as it is lawful for us, to Judge of his will) to wit, by aſſiſting, or furthering the Man with all helps; that he may not be able to alledge for his excuſe, that any thing but his own fault or ſin, did hinder him.

And I have thus long inſiſted upon this, and thus largely quoted theſe Authors, that the World may ſee that in Anſwering the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> our Divines do not uſe to deny that there are Conditional Promiſes, nor do they deny that God gives any help to the called Non-Elect, to enable them to perform the Condition, but affirm, that God gives them more Power and Ability than they make good uſe of; and that if they are not Converted and Saved, they ought to blame themſelves for it, and not God. Ill Men are too much inclined of themſelves, and tempted by the Devil, to lay the blame of their going on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes, upon God; they needed not Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s help to teach them this Leſſon; and therefore he had done better to have ſpared his pains, and to have forborn that irreverent Compariſon in Pag. 57. l. 26, 27, 28, 29. As for the objected Abſurdities he talks of, I have ſhewed that we may very well avoid them upon the Principles of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his Followers; and have no need of the abſurd Principles, either of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, or of Mr. G. and the <hi>Flacians;</hi> nor do we think that one abſurdity is a proper means to ſecure us from another. We know the common ſaying is true, <hi>Dato uno abſurdo, mille ſequuntur,</hi> if one abſurdity be granted, a thouſand more may follow, and therefore we deſire and endeavour to avoid all, by adhering to the true Chriſtian Doctrine, the everlaſting Goſpel, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.7.) as it is recorded in the Holy Scriptures, and commonly profeſſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93175:77"/>that the condition of it. (1.) <hi>Is not in our power.</hi> Nor (2.) <hi>

Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is not a condition properly, but it muſt be ſuch in a Logical ſenſe, And a neceſſary Connexion is enough for that, or in a Phyſical ſenſe, and priority is enough for that.</hi> pag. 33. To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. (1.) That I never wrote, nor thought that the condition of the Goſpel-Covenant is not in our power <hi>in any ſenſe,</hi> but only that it is not in our <hi>meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power;</hi> with which it is very well conſiſtent that it be in our <hi>Supernatural Power,</hi> which we receive from the Spirit of God, and with his aſſiſtance freely uſe in performing the ſaid condition of the Covenant. For the truth of this, I appeal to the common ſenſe and reaſon of all honeſt Men, who will be at the pains to read and conſider what they will find Written in the <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 36. Laſt Paragraph, and pag. 47. at the end. And pag. 48. from l. 1. to l. 13. and pag. 49. from l. 9. to 20. and pag. 50. Where by the Teſtimonies of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> and <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> I expreſly ſhew that the performing of the condition is in our power through the grace of God, and that we have a ſubordinate Dominion and Power over our own Act. And Laſtly, in pag. 67. I ſhew from Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> that we not only have Supernatural Power from God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Act which is the condition; but that at the ſame time when we produce it, we have a Power, a natural Power not to produce it. Whence I conclude that it is a gracious Evangelical condition freely performed by us. See our confeſſion of Faith Chap. 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. Now let any Judge by this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I do <hi>abſolutely</hi> deny the condition to be in our Power? Nay, tho I deny it in <hi>one ſenſe</hi> to be in our Power, yet in <hi>another ſenſe,</hi> I do moſt clearly affirm it to be in <hi>our power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the condition its not being uncertain, nor Meritorious, it is true I did and do maintain that it is not uncertain with reſpect <hi>to God</hi> and the <hi>event,</hi> nor is it in the leaſt truly and properly Meritorious; but I deny the Conſequence, that therefore it is not properly a condition Evangelical. And whereas in the 4th place, he ſays that I deny it to be a <hi>legal</hi> condition, it is true, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and ſhall deny it to be a Legal condition, in the ſenſe explained at large from the end of pag. 37. to 41. It is not <hi>ſo a legal condition,</hi> as to have the ſame place and <hi>Office</hi> in the New-Covenant and Law of Grace, which perfect and perſonal ſinleſs obedience was to have had in the firſt Old Covenant and Law of works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to infer from hence, that becauſe I deny it to be a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal condition <hi>in this ſenſe,</hi> therefore I deny it to be a legal condition <hi>in all and every ſenſe</hi> whatſoever, is a poor fallacious way of arguing. And how can this <hi>R. B.</hi> ſeriouſly think that I ſhould ever deny it to be a legal condition in <hi>any ſenſe at all,</hi> when as he knows that I do all along call it the condition of the Covenant and Law of Grace. If then I believe it to be the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant of Grace, I cannot chuſe but believe it to be a <hi>federal condition;</hi> and ſo if I believe it to be the condition <hi>of the Law of Grace,</hi> I cannot chuſe but in ſome ſenſe believe it to be a <hi>legal condition.</hi> But you may ſay in what ſenſe do I believe it to be a legal condition? Why I Anſwer, look in what ſenſe the Goſpel-Covenant is a Law, in the ſame ſenſe, Faith, for inſtance, is the legal condition of it, and ſo I believe it to be. Now we do not ſay that the Goſpel-Covenant <hi>is meerly and ſimply a Law,</hi> but that it <hi>is a Law of Grace,</hi> properly a Law of Grace. And therefore faith is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>meerly and ſimply legal,</hi> as the condition of the old Law of works was; but it is a condition <hi>graciouſly legal,</hi> becauſe it is the condition of the Law of Grace, and we are effectually enabled to perform it by the God of all Grace.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93175:77"/>This that Brother might have eaſily perceived by our words to be our meaning, if he had <hi>ſought</hi> the Truth ſincerely, when he read our Apology. But tho he ſtile himſelf a <hi>ſeeker,</hi> p. 103. Yet it appears too evident by his Parentheſis p. 33. l. 29.30, 31. That he ſought ſome other thing than the truth, for there he brings me in ſaying <hi>That the Goſpel is a Law, and that this Law is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant,</hi> or Goſpel, and yet it is not a legal condition. But where do I ſay ſo, <hi>That the Law is the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> I defy any Man living to find thoſe words, or any words of the like import in all the <hi>Apol.</hi> I leave it to others whom it may become, to write after this manner, <hi>The Goſpel or the Covenant is a Law, and that Law is the condition of the Covenant.</hi> And ſo the ſame thing is the condition of it ſelf. For ſhame, give over ſuch little tricke, and have regard to <hi>truth and honesty.</hi> But now was there nothing in the <hi>Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I Anſwer, I profeſs ſincerely that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it all from beginning to end, that could give any juſt occaſion, or ſo much as a colourable pretence to charge me with holding that the <hi>Goſpel is a Law or Covenant, and that that Law is the condition of the Covenant.</hi> We have ſaid indeed in the <hi>explication of our ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Law of Grace.</hi> pag. 22. l. 35.36. That this Law of Grace, is the <hi>conditional part of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> But to be the <hi>conditional part of</hi> the Covenant, is quite another thing, than <hi>the condition of the Covenant;</hi> for the conditional part of the Covenant, is that which Preſcribes and Commands the condition, and which promiſes a bleſſing and benefit to the perſon who performs it: And therefore muſt be quite another thing than the condition it ſelf. Here then ſome body has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his <hi>ignorance,</hi> and writes he knows not what; or if not that: He has diſcovered ſomewhat worſe, and that which I forbear to call by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name: Becauſe he might ſay, that it is bitter Language, to tell him his fault in plain terms. It is ſweet unto ſome Men <hi>publickly to miſ-repreſent their brethren</hi> to the People, for ſuch <hi>ends</hi> as they know beſt; but, <hi>it is bitter to them,</hi> for to find themſelves <hi>publickly reproved for it.</hi> We deſire all whom it may concern, to learn to underſtand our <hi>Apol.</hi> before they take upon them to diſpute againſt it and cenſure it. And they may eaſily underſtand it, if they will, for it is purpoſely written in a plain ſtile, that all may know what our Judgment is concerning the nature of the New-Covenant. See pag. 68. from lin. 16. to 21. Where we briefly and plainly diſtinguiſh between the abſolute and conditional part of it, and ſhew what the one, and the other is; as we had alſo done ſo largely before, that none can miſtake our meaning, unleſs they have very weak heads, or, which is worſe, wilfully ſhut their Eyes, that they may throw dirt at us in the Dark.</p>
               <p>His inference then fails, that if faith, for inſtance, be not a condition in a <hi>Law-ſenſe,</hi> it muſt be only in a <hi>Logical,</hi> or <hi>Phyſical ſenſe,</hi> and ſo it will not be a proper condition. For (1.) Why may not ſome <hi>Logical condition</hi> be a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per condition?</hi> (2.) Tho Faith be not a condition in <hi>one Law-ſenſe,</hi> yet it is a condition <hi>in another Law-ſenſe.</hi> It is not a condition <hi>in the ſenſe</hi> of the old Law of works, but it is a condition in the <hi>Senſe of the New Evangelical Law of Grace.</hi> And from hence it appears, that what he ſays of <hi>Logical and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Connexion</hi> in theſe propoſitions (if a Man be reaſonable, he is capable of Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if Wood be laid to the fire it will burn) is wholly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the preſent purpoſe. For in theſe propoſitions, the neceſſity of the Connexion between the Subjects and the Predicates, ariſes from the very <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing;</hi> but in this conditional promiſe [<hi>If thou ſincerely believest,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93175:78"/>thou ſhalt be Juſtified and Pardoned].</hi> The neceſſary truth of the Connexion <hi>Doth not ariſe meerly from the nature of the things, but from the Lord's free and gracious will, and poſitive Law-Conſtitution,</hi> Revealed in the Goſpel. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8 9. And ſo Faith is neither <hi>A meer Logical nor Phyſical condition,</hi> but it is a <hi>Moral Legal condition</hi> in a very ſafe and proper ſenſe; <hi>It is not Legal, in the ſenſe of the Law of works,</hi> but it is <hi>Legal in the ſenſe of the Law of Grace:</hi> And ſo it is a gracious Evangelical condition.</p>
               <p>What he talks, p. 33. l. <hi>ult.</hi> and p. 34. Of the <hi>orderlineſs</hi> of the Covenant, and of the neceſſary conſequence of Juſtification and Glory upon the duties of Faith and Repentance, doth not one jot help him to break the force of our Arguments, and to ſhew, That the Covenant is not conditional, and that the giving of the benefit is not ſuſpended till the Condition be performed. For we ſhewed in the <hi>Apology,</hi> that the Covenant hath indeed an Order in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duty and the Subſequent Benefit; but that, That Order is a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Order constituted by the poſitive will of God,</hi> revealed in the Goſpel; and that it is God's poſitive will to <hi>ſuſpend his giving</hi> of the benefit; for inſtance, pardon of ſin, till we through his grace freely perform the duty of actual Faith: So that we ſhall not be actually pardoned, till we (being adult) have actually believed, and then we ſhall be pardoned, but not before. This we proved, and our Arguments remain unanſwered, and we know they can never be <hi>ſolidly</hi> anſwered. We need no more Arguments to prove the Conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Covenant, in the ſenſe that we hold it to be conditional; tho we are not without other Arguments; and could tell him (what it is like he knows well enough) in what books, written by Orthodox Divines, he may find a great many more Arguments to this purpoſe. To tell people confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That, becauſe it is a Teſtament, it can have no Condition, is to deceive them; For it may very well be a Teſtament, and yet have a gracious Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Condition. A man can make his own Teſtament, ſo as to preſcribe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conditions in it, and ſometimes doth ſo; ſurely then the Lord <hi>could</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Condition in his Teſtament, and <hi>he hath done it:</hi> But as he is a gracious Teſtator, ſo the Condition preſcribed in his Teſtament is gracious too. It ſeems to be the fundamental miſtake of ſome brethren, to think that the Goſpel of Chriſt is a Teſtament ſo abſolute, as not to partake of the nature of a proper Covenant; whereas in truth the Goſpel partakes both of the nature of an abſolute Teſtament, and alſo of a conditional Covenant. And this it may very well do in different reſpects. In reſpect of the abſolute promiſes, it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the nature of an abſolute Teſtament; and, in reſpect of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal promiſes, it partakes of the nature of a conditional Covenant. And then the abſolute promiſe of Grace to perform the condition, makes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional promiſes Eventually ſure to all the elect. And thus the Covenant, is a <hi>Covenant of Grace indeed,</hi> a Covenant well ordered in all things and ſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. But ſaith that <hi>R. B.</hi> pag. 33. By condition, they mean not a condition properly in a <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>federal ſenſe,</hi> as we uſe the word in bargains between Man and Man. Anſwer. What then, doth it follow that becauſe we uſe not the word <hi>condition</hi> properly <hi>in the ſenſe of a humane Law, or Covenant,</hi> therefore it cannot be a proper condition, <hi>in another Law-ſenſe,</hi> to wit, <hi>in the ſenſe of a Divine Law of Grace?</hi> This conſequence we deny, and ſo doth Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> and Mr. <hi>Durham;</hi> and it lies on that brother to prove it, for we do not take his word for a proof. Again in pag. 34. He ſays, <hi>That the conditional Particle (If) uſed in Teſtaments, doth not ſuſpend, but demonſtrate and deſign the thing promiſed.</hi> (Others would ſay, but demonſtrate and deſcribe the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatees),</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93175:78"/>and <hi>ſome certain time and manner of Conveyance.</hi> From whence he would infer that there are no conditional promiſes in the Goſpel. I Anſwer. (1.) Suppoſe that were true of <hi>humane</hi> Teſtaments, which are <hi>purely</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do no ways partake of the nature of a conditional Covenant; it doth not follow that it muſt be true alſo, in the <hi>Divine Teſtament</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which partakes both of the nature of an abſolute Teſtament, and alſo of a conditional Covenant. (2.) It is not univerſally true of humane Teſtaments, for I can make my Teſtament <hi>ſo as to ſuſpend</hi> the giving of certain Legacies to perſons named in it, upon their performing of ſome condition; ſo that if they perform the condition, they ſhall have the Legacies, but not till then: And if they never perform the condition, they ſhall never have the Legacies. But that brother objects further, that if the Author of the <hi>Apol.</hi> by <hi>ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> underſtand a <hi>legal ſuſpenſion,</hi> it is the ſame with a <hi>Legal conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which he has denied before; for <hi>conditio eſt diſpoſitionis ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio ex eventu incerto ei oppoſito,</hi> and has an obliging influence on the promiſer, and confers a title of right to the benefit promiſed. Anſwer. And we have ſhewed that this brother doth foully wreſt the words of the <hi>Apol.</hi> to a ſenſe quite different from <hi>that true ſenſe,</hi> which we <hi>profeſſedly</hi> and <hi>expreſly</hi> give of the word <hi>legal condition.</hi> See in pag. 37.38. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which we give of it at large <hi>on purpoſe to prevent</hi> Mens miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us, as this Man doth. The explication begins thus, [<hi>Which that our meaning</hi> (to wit, of a not Legal but Evangelical condition) <hi>may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all, we explain thus, we do not believe that our faith Repentance and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience, which are conditions of Juſtification and Glorification, according to the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace, have the ſame place and office, in this New Covenant and Law of Grace, which moſt perfect and ſinleſs obedience, had and was to have had in the firſt old Covenant and Law of works,</hi> &amp;c.] Let any honeſt underſtanding Man, read what follows there in ſeveral pages, together with our Arguments from Scripture and Reaſon, and he will ſee it as clear as the light, that we deny the condition of the Goſpel-Covenant, to be a <hi>legal condition,</hi> onely in the ſenſe that works were a condition in the legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that yet notwithſtanding that, and in good conſiſtency with our ſelves, we hold it to be a federal legal condition in another ſenſe. For we all along maintain it to be a condition of the New Covenant and Law of Grace, and ſo to be federal and legal, that is, <hi>Graciouſly and Evangelically federal and legal.</hi> And in conſequence of this, we hold and have proved that the Lord, by his conditional promiſes, hath ſuſpended his giving of the promiſed ſubſequent benefits, till by his Grace the condition be performed. And that brother by denying this ſuſpenſion, not only contradicts us, but in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that there are really any conditional promiſes in the Goſpel, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts all thoſe Scriptures, whereby we have proved that it is God's poſitive will declared in his word, to ſuſpend his giving of the ſubſequent bleſſings promiſed, till the condition required, be, by Grace performed. And all the reaſon he gives for his ſo doing, is that <hi>ſuſpenſion doth always</hi> ſuppoſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>event to be uncertain,</hi> and that where there is a <hi>ſuſpenſion of giving</hi> the promiſed benefit, <hi>Till the condition required be performed,</hi> there <hi>the performing</hi> of the condition, hath an <hi>obliging influence upon God, and gives us a title of right to the benefit promiſed.</hi> Which is a wild aſſertion and a meer begging of the queſtion. It is that which he neither hath proved, nor can <hi>ſolidly</hi> prove to Eternity. For why may it not be certainly determined, as to the event, that ſuch a promiſed benefit ſhall be infallibly given to ſuch a perſon upon ſuch a condition, and yet that the actual giving of it ſhall be ſuſpended, till he

This not only may be, but <hi>de facto</hi> it is ſo, with reſpect to all God's elect. And then tho they moſt certainly receive the benefit, aſſoon as through Grace they perform the condition; yet it doth by no true <hi>Logick</hi> follow, that <hi>their performing the</hi> condition required, <hi>gives them the right</hi> to receive the benefit promiſed; for the Lord Chriſt <hi>purchaſed</hi> for them <hi>both the benefit,</hi> and the <hi>right</hi> to it, and <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of it; and God for Chriſts ſake alone, gives it them aſſoon as the condition is performed. In fine, that brother pag. 45. Saith, <hi>The performing of the duty, is the effect of the Grace of God's Spirit, and effects bear not the Name of conditions.</hi> Anſwer. This objection is borrowed from <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> the <hi>Arminian,</hi> and it was Anſwered in the <hi>Apol.</hi> See there pag. 46.49. and 66.67. Where the world was told that the Grace of God whereby we believe, is ſo far from hindering our <hi>Actual Faith</hi> from being the condition, that on the contrary it conduceth much to make it (tho not ſimply the condition, yet) <hi>The gracious Evangelical</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant. We ſhew'd alſo in the ſame place that God's grace doth not effect and produce our <hi>Actual Faith,</hi> without the free Concurrence of our own faculties. Now you ſhall ſee how <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> the <hi>Arminian</hi> urged this Argument, and how <hi>Triglandius</hi> the Zealou, <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Anſwered it.</p>

Let the places be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. For altho without any previous condition in Man, God cauſeth Remiſſion of ſins to be Preached unto Sinners, yet he doth not Actually confer or give that Remiſſion, but by Repentance, or upon condition of Repentance. Theſe things which are moſt true, I underſtood well enough, and in its own place, I explained, as clearly as I could,</hi> &amp;c.] Thus the great <hi>Rivet</hi> confuted <hi>Grotius,</hi> but of late, we have got another way of confuting him. For there are ſome who indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſilently to confute <hi>Rivet,</hi> (the moſt judicious and ſucceſsful confuter of <hi>Grotius,</hi>) and then they give out to the people, that they have confuted <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> Now from the premiſes it appears, that all which that perſon hath ſaid againſt conditions in the Goſpel-Covenant, is light as vanity; and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is pretended that there are no conditional promiſes in the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe there are no conditions in it; the Contradictory thereunto is really true, That there are conditions in the Goſpel-Covenant, becauſe there are conditional promiſes in it; as was Demonſtrated in the <hi>Apol.</hi> and as hath been generally believed by the reformed Churches unto this day. And tho
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93175:80"/>Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſtiffly deny that there are any conditional promiſes in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant; yet I do not ſee how that is conſiſtent with his conceſſion (in pag. 55. towards the end) that <q>mercy and pardon is offered by the Lord to unbelievers, as a pardon is offered to a Rebel by his Prince; but they reject the mercy, and refuſe to accept of the pardon offered them in the Goſpel: And that aggravates their guilt, and brings upon them a greater puniſhment.</q> For as an unbeliever cannot be ſaid to reject the mercy and refuſe to accept the pardon, which was never ſo much as once offered to him by the Lord: So it cannot be proved that ever mercy and pardon was offered to the unbeliever, without the conditional promiſe of the Goſpel. If mercy and pardon be at all offered, it muſt be by the Goſpel, for the Law offers no ſuch thing to any: And if it be offered by the Goſpel only, I demand how it is offered by the Goſpel, and by what part of the Goſpel? Either it is by the Revelation, or precept, or threatning or promiſe of the Goſpel. But (1.) It is not offered by the meer Revelation of the Goſpel. For according to Mr. G. the Revelation of the Goſpel, is only a Revelation of Mercy and Pardon to the elect, but a Revelation of Mercy and Pardon to the elect only, cannot be an offer of mercy and pardon to the nonelect. Beſides that the meer Revelation of the Goſpel is common to the Church and to the Angels (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.) But tho the Goſpel be revealed to the Angels, yet it doth not by its Revelation make any offer of Mercy and Pardon to them. So that the meer Supernatural Revelation of the Goſpel, is no offer of Mercy and Pardon to the non-elect in the viſible Church. (2.) It is not offered by the meer precept of the Goſpel. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. G. the Goſpel hath no precept of its own. And tho it had a precept, yet that precept would only require ſome duty of them, but by it ſelf could never offer any ſuch benefit as Mercy and Pardon unto them. (3.) It is not offered by the threatning of the Goſpel, for according to him, the Goſpel hath no threatning; and if it had, a meer threatning alone, without a promiſe, is no means of offering Mercy and Pardon to a Man. It remains therefore in the 4th place, that ſince Mercy and Pardon is offered to the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elect unbeliever, it muſt be by the promiſe of the Goſpel. But it cannot be by the abſolute promiſe, for the abſolute promiſe is not made to the non-elect unbeliever; beſides that the abſolute promiſe is always fulfilled, and ſo the non-elect ſhould be certainly pardoned and ſaved. And ſince it is ſo evident that it cannot be by the abſolute promiſe, it muſt of neceſſity be by the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> promiſe, that Mercy and Pardon is offered to non-elect unbelievers in the viſible Church: And conſequently the Goſpel hath a conditional promiſe, for without a conditional promiſe, it is unaccountable how Mercy and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don can be either offered to, or rejected by thoſe unbelievers. Thus we have fully and clearly Anſwered the objections, againſt the Goſpel's having conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal promiſes, and have ſhewed that the denial of them is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Goſpel-offer</hi> of Mercy and Pardon, made to unbelievers in the viſible Church. I ſhould now paſs to the next Chapter, but that I muſt firſt briefly conſider Mr. G's way of Interpreting the places of Scripture, which ſeem to contain conditional promiſes; ſo as to ſhow that they contain no ſuch thing. And the way not to leave one conditional promiſe in all the Scriptures, which are generally thought to contain conditional promiſes, ſuch as <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſaith, Diſ. pag. 58. <hi>Is to aſſert that the import of them is no more but this, that there is an unchangeable Connexion between the bleſſings of the Goſpel, that Faith Repentance and Holineſs are indiſſolubly faſtened, with Pardon, Juſtification and Eternal Life in the ſame
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93175:80"/>perſon; or that God juſtifies and ſaves no Man of ripe years, but whom at his own due appointed time, he makes a believer, brings him to Repentance and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies his Nature.</hi> To which I Anſwer, (1.) That here indeed part of the truth is granted, but not the whole truth; and with the truth which is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is intermixed this great falſehood, that all ſuch Scriptures import <hi>no more,</hi> than the foreſaid unchangeable Connexion between <hi>the bleſſings</hi> of the Goſpel. For they do really import more. (1.) They import that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion is not only indiſſoluble, but that it is <hi>alſo conditional.</hi> For inſtance, that of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, imports manifeſtly that the Connexion between Faith and Salvation, is not only indiſſoluble, but that it is likewiſe <hi>conditional.</hi> As was clearly proved in the <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 50.57, 58, 59. (2.) Such places of Scripture not only import an indiſſoluble unchangeable Connexion between the <hi>bleſſings of the Goſpel;</hi> but they moreover import ſuch a Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>the duties of</hi> the Goſpel and <hi>the bleſſings</hi> of it: Between its antecedent duties and ſubſequent bleſſings. For inſtance Faith is not <hi>only a bleſſing</hi> of the Goſpel; but it is alſo <hi>a commanded duty of the Goſpel.</hi> As it is written, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Here Faith is commanded as a neceſſary duty, which is to be performed by us antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our obtaining of ſalvation; and our obtaining of ſalvation is ſuſpended till we perform that duty, ſo as that if we perform it, we ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. But if we perform it not, we ſhall not be ſaved. <hi>John</hi> 3.36. And <hi>John</hi> 8.24. And the Lord having thus Commanded Faith in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and promiſed us ſalvation upon our believing and ſuſpended his giving us ſalvation untill we through grace have performed the Commanded duty of Faith, there wants nothing to make our actual Faith to be a condition, and the Connexion between the Duty of Faith, and the bleſſing of ſalvation, to be a conditional Connexion. (2dly) Tho I do not ſay that Mr. G. is an <hi>Autinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> by his principle; yet I muſt ſay, that what he aſſerts to be the full im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and meaning of the foreſaid Scriptures, doth not ſeem ſufficient to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Men from <hi>real Antinomianiſm,</hi> becauſe a Man may poſſibly aſſert all this, which he here aſſerts, and yet may not only be <hi>like an Antinomian,</hi> but may be a <hi>moſt real Antinomian.</hi> To make this appear, Conſider (1.) That <hi>it is poſſible and implies no contradiction,</hi> For a Man to be ſo Drunk with error, as to perſwade himſelf that Faith, Repentance, and Holineſs are indeed <hi>bleſſings</hi> which God gives to Men, but that they are <hi>no duties</hi> required of Men. Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would make him believe that they are no duties required <hi>by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> and he may by the help of the Devil make himſelf believe, that as they are not duties required by the Goſpel, ſo they are no duties required of him <hi>by the Law;</hi> and he may ground his falſe perſwaſion upon a falſe Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Ye are not under the Law but under Grace. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (2.) That the Man is certainly a moſt real <hi>Antinomian,</hi> if he be once of this perſwaſion that he is not bound either by Law or Goſpel to believe in Chriſt, to repent of his Sins, and to lead a Holy Life, but that without Tranſgreſſing any precept of the Law (under which, he fancies he is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected and juſtified from Eternity) he may be an impenitent unbeliever and an unholy liver: And as for the Goſpel Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath taught him that it hath no <hi>precept,</hi> and requires no duty of him at all. I hope my <hi>R. B.</hi> will not deny but that ſuch a Man is not only like to the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but that he really is an <hi>Antinomian</hi> Monſter. Conſider (3.) That this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93175:81"/>
                  <hi>Antinomian</hi> in conſiſtency with his <hi>Antinomian</hi> Principle, <hi>may aſſert this</hi> which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith is the <hi>full import of all the foreſaid Scriptures,</hi> which moſt Divines affirm, but Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> denies to contain any conditional promiſes. For (1.) It is the opinion <hi>of this Antinomian</hi> that as ſalvation is a bleſſing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo Faith, Repentance and Holineſs <hi>are bleſſings of the Goſpel,</hi> which God gives to the elect, tho they <hi>be no duties which he requires.</hi> (2.) <hi>This Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> may believe that tho Faith, Repentance and Holineſs be <hi>no duties requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> yet being <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the Goſpel <hi>Which God gives to his elect, he juſtifies and ſaves no Man, but whom at his own due appointed time, he makes a believer, brings him to Repentance, and ſanctifies his nature.</hi> (3.) Upon this, the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> may <hi>aſſert</hi> that there is <hi>an unchangeable Connexion</hi> between Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Holyneſs and Salvation <hi>as bleſſings</hi> of the Goſpel; and that Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Holyneſs are indiſſolubly faſten'd with Pardon, Juſtification and Eternal Life, in the ſame perſon. All this the Man may aſſert and yet be an <hi>Antinomian</hi> ſtill, for he may ſtill hold that, Faith, Repentance and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>are bleſſings</hi> but <hi>no duties,</hi> and that he is not obliged to them either by Law or Goſpel.</p>
               <p>From all which it appears not to be neceſſarily true, which Mr. G. ſaith to wit, that <hi>whoſoever aſſerts this</hi> (Connexion of bleſſings), <hi>Is no Antinomian, nor ſo much as like to ſuch an execrable Monſter.</hi> For I have ſhewed plainly that a Man <hi>may aſſert this,</hi> and yet, <hi>be a most real Antinomian</hi> and hold that <hi>he is obliged to no duty either by Law or Goſpel.</hi> But ſaith Mr. <hi>Goodain, What! Is Holyneſs the condition of obtaining the beatifical viſion? No, tho it doth naturally diſpoſe the Soul, and make it meet for, and capable of, this bliſsful enjoyment.</hi> I Anſwer, and is that ſo ſtrange and wonderful a thing, to hear of Holyneſs its being called a condition required on our part, in order to our obtaining Eternal Life which conſiſts in the beatifical viſion? Is not ſuch a manner of ſpeech ordinary among our Proteſtant Divines? But I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh. Holyneſs is not a Meritorious condition of the beatifical viſion, of our right to it, or of the obtaining of it, and yet it is a <hi>diſpoſitive condition</hi> required of us in order to our obtaining the beatifical viſion, for the alone Meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Ay, but ſays Mr. G. Holyneſs <hi>naturally</hi> diſpoſes the Soul, and makes it meet for that Bliſsful Enjoyment. Anſwer, and as it diſpoſes the Soul for that bleſſedneſs, from the very nature of the thing, ſo doth it likewiſe diſpoſe the Soul for it, by the free <hi>conſtitution of God,</hi> who hath promiſed that bleſſedneſs to Holy Souls; and were it not for <hi>God's promiſe in Chriſt,</hi> the holyeſt Soul on Earth could have no infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of obtaining ſo great bleſſedneſs. For notwithſtanding that <hi>natural diſpoſition,</hi> ariſing from our Holyneſs, God by his Soveraign Dominion might annihilate us, if he had not obliged himſelf by promiſe in Chriſt, to admit all Holy Souls to the Eternal Enjoyment of ſo great Happineſs. I hope my <hi>R. B.</hi> will not deny but that true Mortification is at leaſt a part of that Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which none ſhall ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And yet it hath a conditional Connexion with the bleſſing of Eternal Life. As is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye: But if ye through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall Live. Hence Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> writing againſt Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (who from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Argued that Mortification is a condition required of us, in order to our obtaining Eternal Life? He Anſwered him with a <hi>quis negat?</hi> Which of us Proteſtants denieth that?</p>

Several books on ſeveral ſubjects he publiſhed in his life time: But this expoſition on the Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> was publiſhed after his Death, by the Learned <hi>Gataker</hi> in the year 1620. And on the 8th verſe of the 1 Chap. in pag. 49.50, 51. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He writes thus. <q>The ſecond ſort of perſons, that Chriſt will come in flaming fire to be avenged of, are ſuch as <hi>obey not the Goſpel.</hi> i. e.

In the Goſpel everlaſting ſalvation is offered to all Sinners, that will believe in Chriſt, forſake their ſins, and yeild obedience to the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, ſet down in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles; when therefore God ſhall out of his word, convince our conſciences that we are Sinners, and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Majeſty by our ſins, and when God ſhall offer to be reconciled unto us, to pardon and forgive our Sins, to ſave our Souls from Hell, yea to beſtow everlaſting happineſs in Heaven upon us, if ſo be we will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſins, acknowledge Chriſt Jeſus, for our Lord and Redeemer, and be ſubject to his Diſcipline; when God ſhall ſend, to this end, his Miniſters Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, to offer unto us theſe <hi>conditions,</hi> yea to intreat and beſeech the acceptance of this Grace, and yet we wil not accept of them, we will not have Chriſt Jeſus to Reign and Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For upon whom ſhould he avenge himſelf, if not upon them, which cannot content themſelves to have ſinned againſt God, and ſo to have provoked him, but deſpiſe the means of his grace and favour when they are offered, purpoſing ſtill to continue in their ſins, whatſoever come of it. This is the fearful ſin of many that live in the Church of God, and profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, yea and that look to be ſaved by the blood of Chriſt, who notwithſtanding live and delight (and ſo purpoſe to do) in ſuch ſins, as they know <hi>are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the Goſpel:</hi> They can be content, yea they look for that ſalvation by Chriſt, which is promiſed in the Goſpel, and that the <hi>Covenant on Chriſt's
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93175:82"/>part</hi> ſhould be performed unto them; but they are reſolved <hi>not to keep any Covenant</hi> on their own part. And thoſe for the moſt part that moſt diſobey the Goſpel, and that ſhew moſt contempt to the Miniſtery and Diſpenſation thereof, and are the greateſt enemies that may be to the principal ordinance thereof, <hi>do moſt preſume</hi> of that ſalvation therein which is offered. But let us know that it is not a naked profeſſion of the Goſpel, or a bare belief that can pacify the wrath <hi>of this Judge</hi> in that day, but it muſt be ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and belief, as manifeſteth it ſelf in obedience unto the Goſpel. If it were poſſible for a Man (as it is not) truely to profeſs, and unfeignedly believe the Goſpel, without obeying it, yet that ſhall not ſave him, <hi>He muſt obey it alſo. The Goſpel containeth not matter of Knowledge and Faith only, but of practice alſo:</hi> And ſo many as deſire to be free from the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and fury of <hi>this Judge,</hi> had need in that regard to be acquainted with the Goſpel and all the ordinances thereof: (For how can they obey that which they know not?) And they had need with all diligence and care to be Converſant in the reading and hearing of the Writings of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Apoſtles, of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, for, they are they, which teſtify of this Goſpel, and in them is fully and moſt clearly declared, what manner of obedience is to be performed thereunto.—This Goſpel is here called <hi>the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Ghriſt.</hi> It is not (beloved) our own Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which we Preach unto you, and call you unto the obedience thereof: but it is the Goſpel of our Lord, and our Saviour, and <hi>That which we muſt ſubmit and ſubject our ſelves unto, if we look for ſalvation</hi> from him. When <hi>the Goſpel requireth any thing at your hands,</hi> which ſhall any ways <hi>croſs</hi> your <hi>corrupt deſires,</hi> you are preſently <hi>offended and incenſed againſt us,</hi> that are the poor Miniſters thereof, <hi>As if it were our own Goſpel, and the Law of our own will,</hi> Which we propound unto you. But know you this, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you are, <hi>That it is Chriſt Jeſus our Saviour, that in our perſons you are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with all, and againſt whom you Rebel,</hi> In deſpiſing that Goſpel we teach unto you: Know you alſo that in your <hi>obedience and ſubjection to that Goſpel,</hi> which we Preach unto you, you are <hi>not ſubject and obedient unto us, but</hi> (except you be reprobates) <hi>unto your own Lord and Saviour, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth onely this obedience at your hands, tying the everlaſting ſalvation of your Souls and the Merits of his paſſion thereunto.</hi> To conclude this point then, ſeeing that Chriſt will come in flaming fire, to be avenged of them that ſhall not obey his Goſpel, let the terror of that fire, make us run through water and fire, <hi>rather than diſobey the ſame.</hi>

            <q>
               <hi>The eight Chapter of his Diſcourſe is divided into two parts. In the</hi> (1ſt) <hi>he pretends to Anſwer the Texts of Scripture urged by me in the Apology. And in the</hi> 2d <hi>to Anſwer the Teſtimonies of Fathers and Proteſtant Writers. And accordingly I ſhall aſſign two Sections to my reply.</hi>

               <head>SECT. I.</head>
               <p>IN the Contents of his eight Chapter, he ſays in a Parentheſis, that in the Apology I urged ſome Texts of Scripture, <hi>As expreſly giving the Name of a New Law to the Goſpel.</hi> This is a <hi>notorious falſehood,</hi> And I challenge and defy him to ſhew any paſſage in the whole <hi>Apol.</hi> from beginning to end, In which I ſay, that any one Text of Scripture doth <hi>expreſly give</hi> the Name of <hi>New Law</hi> to the Goſpel. I knew very well that there is not one Text of Scripture, which doth <hi>expreſly</hi> give the Name of <hi>New Law</hi> to the Goſpel, and therefore I never urged one Text to that purpoſe. I ſaid indeed in pag. 22. lin. 16.17. That the Scriptures <hi>expreſsly</hi> call the Goſpel-Covenant of Grace, a <hi>Law,</hi> but never ſaid nor thought that the Scriptures do <hi>expreſsly call</hi> it a <hi>New-Law.</hi> What I ſaid of the Goſpel's being called a <hi>New-Law,</hi> was this, that our Brethren ſhould not be diſpleaſed with us, becauſe we call the Goſpel a <hi>New-Law,</hi> ſince they know (if it be not their own fault), (<hi>Apol.</hi> p. 22. l. 41.42, 43, 44.) That we call it, the <hi>New-Law,</hi> in <hi>no other ſenſe,</hi> than as we call the Covenant of Grace, <hi>the New-Covenant.</hi> From which words it is evident that I do not call the Goſpel a <hi>New-Law,</hi> becauſe I think the Scripture <hi>calls it ſo, expreſly;</hi> (for I did not think any ſuch thing) but becauſe I take the Goſpel-Law for the Covenant of Grace; which is expreſsly called the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> And I think that without offence, we may call the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Law, by the Name of a <hi>New-Law,</hi> in the <hi>ſame</hi> and in <hi>no other ſenſe,</hi> than as we call the Covenant of Grace, the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> For ſince in our Judgment, the <hi>Goſpel-Law,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel-Covenant,</hi> are the ſame thing, and the Goſpel-Covenant is expreſsly called the New-Covenant; what juſt cauſe of offence can there be in calling the Goſpel-Law, the <hi>New-Law,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that we call the Goſpel-Covenant the <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> And we are the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this, by finding that the moſt Ancient Fathers held the <hi>New-Law</hi> and the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> to be one and the ſame thing: And they therefore called the Goſpel-Law a <hi>New-Law,</hi> becauſe they found that the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly calls the Goſpel-Covenant, a <hi>New-Covenant.</hi> No Man can fairly and honeſtly deny this, who reads and underſtands the Writings of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Ireneus, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> Who do all call the Goſpel in its laſt, fulleſt and cleareſt edition ſince the coming of Chriſt, <hi>the New-Covenant,</hi> and

                  <hi>the New-Law,</hi> as by two Names of the ſame Signification. Yea, it ſeems there was an old tradition even amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that in the time of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Lord would make a New-Covenant with his People, that is, a <hi>New-Law.</hi> I ſay, it ſeems there was ſuch a tradition amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> if we may believe what <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> quotes out of their Writers. For after he had cited their expoſition of Canticles the 2d Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 10.11, 12.

Thus far the tradition.</hi>] And it had been well if they had never had a worſe tradition. My deſign in this is only to ſhew that ſince (1.) The Scripture doth expreſsly call the Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> as is now confeſſed. (2.) Since the <hi>Goſpel-Law is the Goſpel-Covenant, made with the Church through Chriſt.</hi> (3.) Since the Goſpel-Covenant, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly called the New-Covenant in Scripture. It follows in the (4th) place by good Conſequence, that without any juſt cauſe of offence, we may very well call the Goſpel-Covenant, the <hi>New-Law</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that we find it called in Scripture <hi>the New-Covenant;</hi> even altho it be <hi>Not in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called the New-Law,</hi> As it is expreſsly called the New-Covenant. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that this may be remembered; and withal that all the Clamour Mr. <hi>G.</hi> after <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> makes againſt the Goſpel's being a <hi>New-Law,</hi> is in truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel's being a <hi>New-Covenant that hath any precept</hi> obliging us to any Duty, with conditional promiſes and threatnings. For as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared often, we mean by the Goſpel's being a <hi>New-Law,</hi> that it is a New-Covenant which by its preceptive part obliges us to certain duties, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to encourage us to the performance of them, and threatnings to reſtrain us from the neglect of them. And principally we mean by its being a New-Law, that it is a New-Covenant with precept and promiſe; and that the threatning is but the ſecondary leſs principal part, which is ſubſervient to the principal. This being premiſed, let us ſee how he Anſwers the Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture urged by me in the <hi>Apol.</hi> And (1ſt) he begins with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. And ſays in the Contents of the Chapter, <hi>That he hath recovered it to its right ſenſe.</hi> Now who that reads this would not think, that in the <hi>Apol.</hi> I had interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this place of Scripture, and had put a wrong ſenſe upon it, ſince writing againſt me he ſaith, that he hath recovered it to its right ſenſe. And yet in this controverſy about the Goſpel's being <hi>a Law,</hi> or <hi>not a Law,</hi> I did not at all interpret that place of Scripture, nor give any ſenſe of it, right or wrong. It is true, I quoted it twice to wit, in p. 22. and 24. But all that I ſaid of it was that from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. It appears that the Goſpel is <hi>Called a Law, its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  </gap> and to put a wrong ſenſe on it, from which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> muſt recover it: Doth not he himſelf acknowledge this to be true? Has not he confeſſed and brought Texts of Scripture to prove that the Goſpel is called <hi>a Law,</hi> and doth he not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with me that the Goſpel is called the Law of Faith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27? How is it poſſible then that he ſhould recover it to its right ſenſe from which I had wreſted it; Since I did not give any ſenſe of it, but only quoted it to ſhew that in the Holy Scripture, the Goſpel-Covenant is called a <hi>Law, the Law of Faith;</hi> and that the brethren ought not to be diſpleaſed with us, for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Goſpel a <hi>Law, becauſe</hi> the <hi>Holy Scripture expreſsly calls it a Law and the Law of Faith.</hi> Rom. 3.27. Here (Diſc. p. 59.) it is where he calls his book, a poor Writing; and if this Chapter together with the reſt, do not prove it to be poor and blind and naked, I am much miſtaken. But becauſe I am a fallible Man, and liable to miſtake, as other Men are; I will now affirm no ſuch thing of his diſcourſe; but will hear and conſider what he ſaith for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering Scripture to its <hi>Right ſenſe, from which I did not wreſt it</hi> firſt then p. 59. he ſays that by the words [Law of Faith.] In <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. The Apoſtle means <hi>no more</hi> than that <hi>Doctrine of Grace which declares a believing Sinner to be Juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Christ, which by Faith he receiveth.</hi> But now what if a body ſhould deny that the Apoſtle means <hi>no more,</hi> and ſhould affirm that he <hi>alſo</hi> means that <hi>the Law of Faith</hi> is a Doctrine of Grace <hi>which requires Faith,</hi> as the receptive condition, or inſtrumental means of Juſtification <hi>by the Mediator's Righteouſneſs?</hi> Might he not prove what he had affirmed, by an Argument taken from this Text, where the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> is expreſsly <hi>oppoſed</hi> to the Law of works [where is boaſting then? It is excluded by what Law? Of works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.] Thus, the Law of works is the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> or Doctrine which requires works that we may be juſtified by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own works, which doth not exclude boaſting. Therefore the Law of Faith, is the Law or Doctrine which <hi>requires Faith,</hi> that we may be Juſtified only by and for Chriſt the Mediators Righteouſneſs, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude boaſting. And further might not a Man for this Interpretation alledge the Teſtimony of our Confeſſion of Faith, (which, Chap. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. Saith, [that the Lord in the Covenant of Grace (i. e. <hi>the Law of Faith</hi>) freely offers unto Sinners Life and Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>requiring</hi> of them Faith in him, that they may be ſaved.] But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> oppoſes two things to this. (1.) He ſaith this Interpretation doth not exclude boaſting. (2.) It is contrary to the Judgment of all the right Proteſtants who have commented on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Firſt he ſaith, p. 59. that this Interpretation <hi>Doth not exclude boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but rather greatly promotes it: For why ſhould not a Man Glory in his Faith, if it be an Act of obedience to this New-Law,</hi> i. e. <hi>this Evangelical Law of Faith, which by its ſtatute makes his Juſtification to depend on this his performance?</hi> I Anſwer, I do not know the tempers of all Men, nor of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> it may be for ought I know, that he or ſome other of like temper, doth really think that he might juſtly boaſt of and Glory in his Faith, if the Evangelical Law or New-Covenant did require Faith of him in order to his being juſtified by and for Chriſt's Mediatorial Righteouſneſs. But I would ask ſuch a Man a few queſtions. And (1.) What is a Man's believing that he may be juſtified? <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. Is that believing a doing nothing, or a doing ſomething? I hope, Sir, you will not ſay, that it is a <hi>doing nothing.</hi> For if it were a doing nothing, then <hi>Paul's</hi> meaning in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. Would be this, [we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be Juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, that is, <hi>We have done nothing in Jeſus Christ, that we might be Juſtified by doing nothing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>]
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93175:84"/>Which if it be not an abominable wreſting of the Apoſtles words, and a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into non-ſenſe; let all Men Judge that have the ſober uſe of their reaſon. But if you ſay, that believing in Chriſt, is a doing <hi>ſomething.</hi> I ask again, is that doing <hi>ſomething,</hi> the doing of ſome good thing, or ſome evil thing? I hope, you dare not ſay that it is a doing of ſome evil thing: And therefore you muſt ſay that it is a doing of ſome good thing. And then I ask again, is that good thing required and Commanded by any Law of God? or is it not at all commanded? If you ſay that it is not at all Commanded (nor forbidden) by any Law of God. Then I ſay (1.) That it is not <hi>Moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good,</hi> but of an indifferent middle nature between Moral good and evil. For what is not at all Commanded nor forbidden, is perfectly indifferent and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Morally good nor evil. (2.) Then it follows neceſſarily that you are not at all bound to believe, and that you do not ſin, tho you never believe in Chriſt. (3.) Then it follows that to be juſtified by Faith, is to be juſtified by doing a thing indifferent. (4.) Then it follows that juſtifying Faith is of a contradictious nature, for it is good and not good. It is good, as is now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and it is not good, becauſe it is not commanded by any Law of God. But if you chooſe the other Member of the disjunction, and ſay that Faith in order to Juſtification is required and commanded by ſome Law of God; then ſince that Law of God is not his poſitive Evangelical Law of the New-Co-venant, (for that you have now denied it to be, for fear of promoting boaſting) it remains that it muſt needs be the Moral natural Law only, which requires and commands Faith in Chriſt as indiſpenſably neceſſary to Juſtification in perſons of riper years But now, Sir, by your own Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 59. I prove that the Moral-natural-Law doth not require and command Faith as indiſpenſably neceſſary, to receive Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Juſtification. For if a Man's juſtifying Faith were <hi>An Act of Obedience to God's Moral-natural-Law, boasting would not be excluded,</hi> But rather a great occaſion would be given to promote it. For <hi>Why ſhould not a Man Glory in his Faith,</hi> if it be <hi>an Act of Obedience</hi> to the Moral-natural-Law, which hath made it indiſpenſably neceſſary to receive Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for Juſtification. He may then plead that he hath done what was required; and ſo he may as well claim pardon and a right to life, on the account of having done all that this Moral-natural-Law hath under the Goſpel made neceſſary to his receiving Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for his Juſtification: As <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his Primitive State, might have formed a Plea of his Right to life; for having diſcharged all that Duty which the Law of Works commanded and propoſed, as the condition of his being eternally bleſſed. Thus Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is caught in his own Net, and he is held in it ſo faſt, that upon his Principles laid down in his Diſcourſe, he can never get out of it. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> indeed ſtrives to avoid this by maintaining, That we are juſtified by the Habit of Faith, and not by any Act of Faith required of us, and done by us; and though by this he contradicts the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.24. and 10.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16.) and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, and Catechiſm, and all Proteſtant Divines that I know; yet that is nothing, ſo long as it ſerves a Turn. But for Mr. <hi>G.</hi> I am apt to think he will not take that courſe to extricate himſelf; for he hath ſtrenuouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in his Diſcourſe of the Goſpel, That Juſtifying Faith is a Duty comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the moral law (and ſo did Mr. <hi>C.</hi> before him): and here in this very Chapter under conſideration, he affirms, That Juſtifying Faith receives Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for Juſtification. But the Habit of Faith is it ſelf received, and doth not by it ſelf, without the Act, receive any thing at all.</p>

               <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, Though this be a ſufficient Anſwer to your brother Mr. G. yet what if an Enemy to our Religion ſhould aſſault us with the ſame Argument, how would you anſwer it? To ſuch I ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That he would be a very contemptible Enemy that ſhould uſe ſuch a Poor Argument againſt our Religion. (2.) I would tell him, That though our Faith in Chriſt be an Act of Obedience to the law of Faith, yet we ought not to boaſt of it, and that for this very reaſon (amongſt others), becauſe it is an Act of Obedience and Duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.9, 10. Doth he thank that Servant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did the things which were commanded him to do? I trow not. (Saith our Saviour) So likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall have done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) I would tell him, That we ought not to be proud, and to boaſt of our Faith, becauſe it is by the ſpecial diſcriminating Grace of God that we are enabled to believe, and that we actually believe in Chriſt for Juſtification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? and if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thouglory, as if thou didſt not receive it?</hi> (4.) I would tell him, That though our Juſtifying Faith be really an Act of Obedience to the Evangelical Law of Faith, yet we cannot glory that we are juſtified by it, as it is an Act of Obedience. For it is not true, That we are Juſtified by it under that formal conſideration, as it is an <hi>Act of Obedience;</hi> but we are Juſtified by it as it is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly appointed by God to be the Condition of the New-Covenant, or to be the Receptive Applicative Condition, and Inſtrumental Means whereby we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, and truſt to be juſtified and ſaved by him, and for his righteouſneſs only. (5.) I would tell him, That tho our Faith in Chriſt be an Act of Obedience to the law of Faith, yet we cannot plead, That we ſhould be juſtified for our Faith, and our Obedience therein to the law of Faith; as <hi>Adam</hi> (if he had perſevered in his Innoceccy) might have pleaded, That he ſhould have been juſtified for his perfect Obedience to the law, and Covenant of VVorks; becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s Perſonal Perfect Obedience to the law of VVorks was to have been his intire juſtifying Righteouſneſs, for which he ſhould have been juſtified and lived: whereas our Faith and Obedience therein to the law of Faith, is not any the leaſt part of that juſtifying righteouſneſs for which we are pardoned, and have a right to eternal life; but it is only the ſpecial Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Mean appointed by God, whereby we receive and truſt to the Mediator's Righteouſneſs, as that by and for which alone we are Juſtified and Saved. And by this it plainly appears, That though Faith be required by the law of Faith, yet that ſame law of Faith excludes boaſting. But,</p>
               <p>in the 2d place, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> ſaith, This Interpretation is contrary to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the right Proteſtants who have Commented on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> I Anſwer, That I have ſhewed before, that this is the very Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.

                  <hi>By what law, that is, by what Doctrine? As ſometimes among the</hi> Jews, <hi>the word</hi> Torah, <hi>Law, ſignifies in general, a Doctrine which preſcribes any thing: Accordingly the Apoſtle calls the Goſpel, the aw of Faith,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which propoſes ſalvation, on condition, if thou believeſt, which very conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God alſo gives us power to perform; and this is oppoſed to the Doctrine,</hi> (to wit of the Law <hi>which propoſes Righteouſneſs and Salvation with the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if thou ſhalt do all, which Chriſt alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

He ſays the word <hi>Law</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> ſignifies indeed a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but a <hi>Doctrine</hi> that preſcribes ſomething (2.) That the Law of works is a Doctrine that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes works, of perfect obedience as the condition of life. (3.) That the Law of Faith or Goſpel, is a Doctrine which preſcribes Faith as the condition, and which propoſes ſalvation upon condition of believing. (4.)

That God gives us <hi>power</hi> to perform the <hi>condition</hi> of the Goſpel, or the condition which the <hi>Law of Faith requires to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> And that in <hi>Beza</hi>'s Judgment the Law and Doctrine of Faith ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to believe in order to Juſtification, is evident alſo by what follows; where he ſaith that it doth <hi>(flagitare) require</hi> Faith of us, and Faith only as that whereby we apprehend and receive the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, and freely gives unto us for our Juſtification. And altho he hold that the Law of Faith, obligeth us to believe in Chriſt for Juſtification, yet he ſhews how it excludes all boaſting. Now this is the very ſenſe which we give of the Law of Faith, that it is ſuch a Doctrine of Grace as hath the force of a Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

This being as clear as the light, with what Conſcience did my Reverend brother tell the world in Print that <hi>Beza</hi> was for him againſt us, and that <hi>Beza</hi> gives the ſame ſenſe of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Which he gives. And of this he gives no other reaſon, but this, that <hi>Beza</hi> calls the Law of Faith a <hi>Doctrine</hi> which can be no Argument of his denying that the Law of Faith commands Faith, becauſe in the very ſame place he calls <hi>The Law of works a Doctrine, likewiſe:</hi> And yet it is confeſt by all, that the Law of works commands works. Here again the poverty of Mr. <hi>G's.</hi> diſcourſe appears, and not only
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93175:85"/>that, but its nakedneſs too; in ſo much that it wants a covering to hide its ſhame and by this I hope Mens eyes will be oppened to ſee what credit is to be given to him, who thus ſhamefully abuſeth <hi>Beza</hi> by clipping his Tongue, and not ſuffering him to ſpeak the truth; but fathering upon him an opinion which is moſt evidently contrary unto his words. 2. Here likewiſe I deſire it may be obſerved that in the old <hi>Geneva</hi> Tranſlation of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, which is of an hundred years ſtanding at leaſt, there is this ſhort <hi>note</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. [<hi>By what Doctrine? Now the Doctrine of works hath this condition joyned with it, if thou doſt; and the Doctrine of Faith, hath this condition, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt.</hi>] Altho then of old, our forefathers <hi>by Law of Faith,</hi> underſtood a <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> yet they held it to be <hi>ſuch a Doctrine,</hi> as preſcribes the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and requires the condition of believing; and that makes it to be an <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Law</hi> juſt as we hold it to be.</p>
               <p>What he talks in pag. 60.61, 62. Of all the Popiſh Commentators on <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. And of <hi>Eſtins</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> &amp;c. Is nothing but <hi>ad populum phalerae,</hi> and is partly impertinent, and partly ridiculous.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith, That <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. refuſes to ſerve <hi>my</hi> deſign. But I anſwer, It's plain from the <hi>Apology,</hi> page 22. line 16, 17. that my whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in quoting <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. was to ſhow, that the Scripture calls the Goſpel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant a <hi>Law;</hi> and ſo it may be called there, notwithſtanding of what Mr. G. ſays to the contrary. For though the words <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> do not import the whole of the Goſpel-covenant, yet they import a part of it, to wit, the <hi>precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part.</hi> For certainly he that loves his Neighbour, as Chriſt loved him, doth believe in Chriſt with a Faith working by love; and he that ſo believes in Chriſt, doth certainly fullfil the Condition of the Goſpel-Govenant, and by Conſequence he that loves his Neighbours as Chriſt loved him doth, fulfill the condition of the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, which is the Law of Chriſt. As to what Mr. G. objects, That <hi>Eſtins</hi> on the place affirms, that Chriſt is given to men as a Legiſlator, whom they may obey. I anſwer; That Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> affirms the ſame thing, as is evident by his expreſs formal words quoted before in the Remarks on the 7th Chapter. It is true, he doth not there prove Chriſt to be a <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> from <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. but that is no matter; he affirms that he is a <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> and then he hath an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical law. And this being a Truth, I, for my part, do like it never the worſe, becauſe an Adverſary believes it. I wiſh our Adverſaries, both Papiſts and Arminians, did with us receive not only that, but all other Truths. If Mr. G. ſay, that the word <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-Covenant,</hi> is not expreſſed in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. I anſwer. Nor did I ſay that it is: But there is expreſly the word <hi>Law,</hi> and I thought that ſufficient to the purpoſe, for which I quoted that Text. And though I ſhould paſs from that Text, to pleaſe my Reverend Brother, yet the other Texts do abundantly anſwer my whole deſign, and prove, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is expreſly called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">(3.) And therefore it is not true which he ſays in the 3d place, That <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.4. is not effectual to prove my Aſſertion; for my Aſſertion there, is, That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expreſly calls the Goſpel a law, which it really doth in that very place, as Mr. G. himſelf confeſſeth in Page 63. and I deſire no more to prove my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, which only was concerning the word <hi>Law,</hi> its being there uſed of the Goſpel; but not at all concerning what ſenſe it is uſed in. I meddled not with the ſenſe of the word <hi>Law, there</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> and all that I ſhall do <hi>now,</hi> ſhall be to deſire the Reader to take the ſenſe not from me, but from Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> in theſe words <hi>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And it ſeems the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> thought ſo too, and therefore ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. That his Commandments are not grievous.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) There is one Text more, to wit, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. which, he ſays, I urged to prove, That the Goſpel is a new Law with Promiſes and Threatnings. But that is another miſtake; for I did not urge it to prove <hi>that,</hi> but I quoted it to prove, That Chriſt <hi>will account them his Enemies, and puniſh them as ſuch, who do not like his Goſpel, becauſe it is a Law of Grace which obligeth men to duty, with a promiſe of bleſſing</hi> to the performers, and with a <hi>threatning</hi> of miſery and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the neglecters, refuſers and deſpiſers. This is as clear as the light to any that reads and underſtands the <hi>Apology,</hi> Pag. 22 line 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>As for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. which he quotes, I have ſpoken to it before, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how he wreſts that Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> For his wondering at my ſaying, That the Law (or Covenant) of Grace, is both new and old in different reſpects; I regard it not, if he had not been reſolved to cavil at my words, and to wreſt them from their genuine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſenſe, he would have found in them no cauſe of wondering. Let any man of common Senſe and Honeſty read the <hi>Apology,</hi> Page 22. at the end, and Page 23. at the beginning, and then let him judge whether there be any thing in that part of it, but words of Truth and Soberneſs. So much for anſwer to the firſt part of his Eighth Chapter, concerning Texts of Scripture.</p>

               <p>In the ſecond part of his Eighth Chapter, he pretends to anſwer the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Fathers and Proteſtant Divines, which I alledged in the <hi>Apology,</hi> to prove that <hi>new law of grace,</hi> are not <hi>new words</hi> of an old ill meaning. To all that he writes on this Head, one general anſwer might ſuffice, to wit, That he impertinently gives his <hi>own ſenſe</hi> of their words; whereas that was not the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Queſtion, <hi>In what ſenſe</hi> the Fathers and Proteſtant Divines have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Goſpel, <hi>a law, a law of grace;</hi> aed ſometimes <hi>a new law;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did ever ſo call it all? whether they did <hi>ever uſe thoſe words, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did not uſe them; and ſo whether the words be old, or but new, and of an old ill meaning?</hi> This was the State of the controverſie, as manifeſtly appears by the <hi>Apology,</hi> Page 24. line 15, 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Mr. G. is ſo far from deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter of Fact, that he plainly confeſſes it, and moreover brings ſome other Teſtimonies to prove, That the Goſpel was called <hi>a Law</hi> by the Ancients, and by ſome modern Writers, as we have ſeen before. Now this was all that I deſigned to prove by the Humane Teſtimonies which I cited in the <hi>Apology.</hi> I might therefore ſtop here, ſince my Teſtimonies remain in full force with reſpect to the matter of Fact, for the Proof whereof they were alledged by me. But ſince Mr. G. hath endeavoured to pervert the ſenſe of my witneſſes, I will, <hi>ex ſuper abundanti,</hi> conſider what he hath ſaid to wreſt their words from their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuin ſenſe. And I begin with <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> firſt confeſſeth that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> called the Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> and if he had been ſo ingenuous to confeſs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he called it a <hi>New-law,</hi> as he certainly did, and as I proved by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words, then he had confeſſed alſo, That I did very pertinently quote <hi>Juſtin,</hi> and that his Teſtimony clearly proved <hi>the matter of fact,</hi> for the proof whereof it was alledged, to wit, That <hi>new law</hi> is not a <hi>new word of an old ill meaning:</hi> but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93175:86"/>it ſeems we muſt not expect that Mr. G. will be ſo ingenuous as to confeſs <hi>the whole Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſaith, That by <hi>law,</hi> Juſtin <hi>meant no more than</hi> a new Doctrine of Grace, to wit, a Doctrine that requires no Duty of us at all: And this he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove by the Deſign which <hi>Juſtin</hi> had in anſwering <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew:</hi> whereunto I anſwer, That <hi>Justin</hi> did not mean, by calling the Goſpel a <hi>new law,</hi> that <hi>it is no more but a Doctriue of grace,</hi> more excellent than the Jewiſh law and its ceremonies, which requires <hi>no duty of us at all:</hi> Nor doth any ſuch thing appear by the words and Deſign of <hi>Juſtin.</hi> Now to clear this, I will ſhew the True Occaſion of <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s mentioning the <hi>new law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> and his real deſign in ſo doing, which <hi>my</hi> R. B. hath not faithfully done. The True Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then was this, <hi>Trypho,</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> in the foregoing Page, 227. had confeſſed that <hi>there were Precepts in the Goſpel, ſo great and wonderful,</hi> that he doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was poſſible for any man to keep them; but withal he affirmed, That he did wonder alſo, that the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who made ſo great profeſſion of being of the True Religion, and of excelling all other men, and yet kept not the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> obſerved not <hi>the Solemn Feaſts and Sabbaths,</hi> were not circumciſed, and moreover, truſted in a crucified man; did nevertheleſs hope to obtain any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God, ſince they did not keep <hi>his law.</hi> Haſt thou not read (ſaid <hi>Trypho</hi>) That the man who was not circumciſed the Eighth Day, ſhould be cut off from his People, and that this was ordained alike, with reſpect to Strangers, and thoſe who were bought with money. This Covenant (ſaith the <hi>Jew</hi>) you Chriſtians deſpiſe, and regard not the Precepts of it; and yet ye would perſwade your ſelves. That you know God, though you do none of thoſe things which they do that fear God. If thou haſt any thing to ſay in thine own defence againſt theſe things, and canſt ſhew what ground you have to hope for mercy from God, tho you do not keep his Law; we ſhall moſt willingly hear thee. Thus argued the <hi>Jew.</hi> And hence it was, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> took occaſion to mention the <hi>new law</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi> in his Anſwer to the foreſaid Diſcourſe of the <hi>Jew;</hi> which Anſwer he thus begins:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There never was, O <hi>Trypho!</hi> nor ever will be another God, beſides him who created the whole world; and we have no other God than you, none but that ſame God who brought your fathers out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Nor do we truſt in any other (for there is no other), but in him, in whom you truſt alſo, to wit, the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> And we truſt in him, and hope to be ſaved, not by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor by the Law, to wit, of <hi>Moſes. But I have read, O</hi> Trypho, <hi>that there ſhould be a latter or after-Law, and a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.</q> As theſe words and what follows them, are cited in the <hi>Apol.</hi> p. 24. <q>
                     <hi>This New-Law or Covenant,</hi> Juſtin <hi>ſaith, all Men must keep,</hi> That would be ſaved.</q> Then alluding to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. He ſaith, Chriſt was given to be this Eternal and <hi>latter-Law</hi> unto us, and a ſure Covenant, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which there is neither Law, nor precept, nor Commandment. (How that paſſage of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> is to be underſtood, I have ſhewed before): Then he proves out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> that Chriſt was to come, and that through him God would make <hi>this New and laſt Law,</hi> or Covenant with his Church conſiſting</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles. And ſince God was to do thus, he concludes from the converſion of the Gentiles from Idols to Faith in the crucified Jeſus; and from their Holineſs of Life, and perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs to the Death that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was already come, and that this was the New-Law and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which the Chriſtians lived under, and according to the terms whereof they hoped to be ſaved through Chriſt believed on. For, ſaith <hi>Juſtin,</hi> we are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93175:87"/>the true Spiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſpiritual progeny of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (who in his uncircumciſion, by Faith obtained a good Teſtimony from God, and was bleſſed and called the Father of many Nations) even we who are brought near unto God by this crucified Chriſt. This he confirms from <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55. <hi>v.</hi> 3.4, 5. <q>Then tells them, this very Law, ye <hi>(Jews)</hi> diſgrace, and vilify his New and Holy Covenant (where he manifeſtly diſtinguiſhes the <hi>Covenant</hi> from the Lord himſelf) neither do ye to this day receive it, nor repent of your evil deeds. The <hi>Legiſlator</hi> is come and preſent, and you ſee him not.</q> The poor receive the Goſpel, and the blind ſee, but you do not underſtand. Then he tells them that they needed another Spiritual Circumciſion, and Sabbath and Unleavened bread and waſhing: That God was not like them, pleaſed with thoſe external Rites and Ceremonies, but that now by the <hi>New Law and Covenant,</hi> he called them to true Evangelical Repentance, and Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, which alone can waſh away ſin and expiat the guilt of it. To prove this he cites thoſe Scriptures menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> he ſtops not there, but goes on and tells the <hi>Jews</hi> that their External Rites, Waſhings and Sacrifices, were but Types and Shadows of the inward Spiritual Waſhing and Purification of Gods People by the Blood, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and word of Chriſt. Wherefore he exhorts <hi>Trypho,</hi> and his Company to <q>Faith and Repentance according to the Tenour of the New-Covenant:</q> And that he doth in the words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 55. from <hi>v.</hi> 3. To the end. Now this was not the old Law and Covenant of works; but the New Law or Covenant of Grace, which <hi>Juſtin</hi> in the words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Preached to theſe <hi>Jews.</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] pag. 231. This is that very thing, which this <hi>New Law-giver</hi> Judges fit and meet to require of you. From the premiſſes it is manifeſt, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> did not think the <hi>New-Law</hi> or Covenant, to be a Doctrine of Grace in <hi>ſuch a ſenſe</hi> as to <hi>require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of us</hi> at all; for there, and through the whole Dialogue, he ſhews that Faith and Repentance, and Evangelical obedience are required by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Law and Covenant, and ſays expreſsly that this Covenant all Men muſt <hi>keep</hi> that would obtain poſſeſſion of the Inheritance of God. Thus he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the <hi>Jew's</hi> objection, and ſhewed that Chriſtians had ground to hope for Mercy and Salvation, tho they kept not the old Sinaitical Covenant becauſe they had received from God a <hi>New-Law and Covenant</hi> of Grace which they <hi>kept,</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> it they were ſure to obtain the pardon of their Sins, and ſalvation of their Souls, through the Blood and Death of Chriſt the Mediator and ſurety of that New and better Covenant. That this is the true ſenſe of <hi>Juſtin</hi> is evident by what I quoted out of him before in my remarks on Mr. G'<hi>s.</hi> 7th Chapter; by what I have here related concerning the <hi>Jew's</hi> Objection, and his Anſwer to it, which was the true occaſion of his mentioning <hi>the New Law and Covenant;</hi> And by what he writes in pag. 243. 263, 323, 327. I might now paſs from <hi>Juſtin</hi> to a vindication of the Teſtimonies of <hi>Cyprian</hi> from the exceptions made againſt them by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> if another Reverend Brother in his niblings at our <hi>Apol.</hi> had not pretended to prove in his Book on <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. That I impertinently quoted <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi> His words in pag. 35. Are theſe <q>[I ſhall (ſaith Mr. <hi>C.</hi>) on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtance his firſt citation out of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and I am willing to be Judged by any of the Subſcribers that will take the pains to read it, if <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin intends any thing more,</hi> than the recommending the Chriſtian Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and proving it preferable to the <hi>Moſaical;</hi> for he ſays, This <hi>new law</hi> is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93175:87"/>poſterior to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; but the <hi>Apologiſts new law</hi> has been ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </q> Thus Mr. <hi>C.</hi> whoſe Arguments are to be conſidered before I paſs any further.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> anſwer then thus, That <hi>Juſtin</hi> intended the recommending of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Conſtitution of the Covenant af Grace, and proving it preferable to the <hi>Moſaical,</hi> was never denied by me, (tho <hi>I</hi> deny that he intended <hi>no more</hi> than the recommending of it in Mr. <hi>C.</hi> his ſenſe;) for <hi>I</hi> did and do moſt firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That that was part of his Deſign; and the other part of it was to prove againſt <hi>the Jew,</hi> That the New Law, or Covenant of Grace, was now to be kept, as it is in its Chriſtian Conſtitution; and that the keeping of it <hi>as ſuch,</hi> was ſufficient to the obtaining of ſalvation; and that the keeping of it in its <hi>Moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Conſtitution,</hi> or form of Adminiſtration was not now neceſſary as <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> pretended. But then, good Sir, conſider that in proſecution of that deſign, he expreſsly calls the Chriſtian conſtitution of it as ſuch <hi>a New-Law</hi> and Covenant of the greateſt or moſt excellent Authority of all, which all Men now muſt keep, whoſoever they be, that would obtain poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Inheritance of God. Now I appeal to all Men of Common ſenſe and reaſon, if withal they have but common honeſty, whether this citation was not very pertinent to my purpoſe, which was to prove that the <hi>accuſer of the brethren</hi> had aſſerted a notorious falſehood, in matter of fact, in ſaying that <hi>New-Law</hi> of Grace was a <hi>New-word</hi> of an old but ill meaning. To convince him of falſehood in this <hi>matter of fact</hi> (as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly declare in pag. 24. lin. 16.17, 18, 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Was what I mainly intended in quoting <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> with others, who expreſsly mention the words, <hi>New-Law</hi> and <hi>New-Law of Grace,</hi> in a good ſenſe and meaning, long before we were born. And I am ſure the words I cited out of <hi>Juſtin</hi> with the words of my other Witneſſes, do clearly and effectually prove what I alledged them for. And if my Reverend brother, be willing to be Judged (as he ſays he is) by any of the Subſcribers after they have read the place, whether he did not ſay true, that <hi>Juſtin</hi> was not pertinently alledged in the <hi>Apology;</hi> I now tell him plainly, that he will certainly be Condemned by them as to this matter; for aſſuredly ſeveral of the Subſcribers have read the place in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> and do Judge that it was cited very pertinently to the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned purpoſe. And Mr. <hi>C.</hi> himſelf doth not deny, but confeſs that <hi>Juſtin</hi> called the Goſpel a <hi>New-Law,</hi> for the Covenant in its Chriſtian conſtitution is the Goſpel, and he confeſſes that that was the thing which <hi>Juſtin</hi> called a <hi>New-Law.</hi> But Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> (1.) <hi>Juſtin ſays that this New-Law is poſterior to</hi> Moſes <hi>his Law; but the Apologiſt's New-Law has been ever ſince the Fall of</hi> Adam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What he calls the Apologiſt's New-Law, is not the Apologiſt's, it is not a Law of the Apologiſts own invention, but it is the <hi>Lords own New-Law,</hi> or Covenant of Grace. This brother by this paſſage, brings to my mind what I cited before out of Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> on the 2d <hi>Theſſal.</hi> his words are, [<hi>When the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth any thing at your hands, which ſhall any ways croſs your corrupt deſires, you are preſently offended and incenſed againſt us, that are the poor Miniſters thereof, as if it were our own Goſpel, and the Law of our own will, which we propound unto you. But know you this, whoſoever you are, that it is Chriſt Jeſus our Saviour, that in our perſons, you are offended withal,</hi> &amp;c.] See the reſt, before. (2.) I Anſwer, it is not true that according to the <hi>Apology, this New-Law or Covenant of Grace as we Chriſtians have it</hi> (and we have it in its Chriſtian conſtitution) hath been <hi>ever ſince the Fall of Adam.</hi> The Apology ſaith no ſuch thing, but the quite
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93175:88"/>contrary. For there in the <hi>Apology,</hi> I diſtinguiſh and ſay, that this <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> or Goſpel-Covenant, is both New and Old in different reſpects, and I affirm <hi>expreſsly</hi> in ſo many formal words, that the Law of Grace, <hi>As we Chriſtians have it, is called new, becauſe we have the neweſt and cleareſt, and laſt edition of it.</hi> pag. 22. lin. 48.49. And again in pag. 23. lin. 5.6. <hi>That it will continue in its neweſt and excellenteſt form unto the end of the world.</hi> Whence it manifeſtly appears, that the <hi>Apology</hi> doth not ſay that the <hi>New Law of Grace</hi> in its <hi>laſt and cleareſt edition,</hi> and in its neweſt and excellenteſt form of Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as we Chriſtians have it, and as it is to continue unto the end of world; <hi>Has ever been ſince the Fall of Adam,</hi> and that it was before the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> On the contrary any Man who is not blind may ſee that we hold with <hi>Juſtin,</hi> that the <hi>New-Law thus conſidered,</hi> is indeed the <hi>New-Goſpel-Covenant in its Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian conſtitution,</hi> and that it is <hi>Poſterior</hi> to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>preferable</hi> to it. But now tho <hi>in this reſpect</hi> the Evangelical-Law of Grace (<hi>as we have it,</hi> in its laſt and excellenteſt form of Adminiſtration) be <hi>newer</hi> than the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet (1.) It follo vs not by any true <hi>Logick,</hi> that therefore it is a new device of the Apologiſts. Nor (2.) Doth it follow that <hi>the ſubſtance</hi> of the ſame <hi>New-Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> hath not been in the Church ever ſince the firſt promiſe of Grace made to our firſt parents after the fall; as in the <hi>Apology</hi> pag. 23. l. 1.2, 3. I aſſerted it to have been; and ſo to have been old <hi>in that reſpect;</hi> tho it be alſo <hi>New in reſpect of the form of Adminiſtration,</hi> In which Chriſtans have had it ſince Chriſts time, and will continue to have it till his ſecond coming again. I hope Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will not deny but that the <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and ſubſtance</hi> of the Goſpel-Covenant, hath always ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> had a being in the Church of God, tho it hath been under ſeveral forms of Adminiſtration, and we have it now under its laſt, neweſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt form, and therefore <hi>as ſuch</hi> it hath been uſually called the <hi>New-Law</hi> by Chriſtian Writers, even by the pureſt and ancienteſt of them ſince the Apoſtles. If my <hi>R. B.</hi> think that the Goſpel-Covenant as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it, hath not been always in the Church ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> tho in reſpect of its Chriſtian form of Adminiſtration it be poſterior to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> let him ſpeak out, and ſee what will be the iſſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But <hi>Juſtin</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>C.</hi>) calls Chriſt <hi>the New-Law,</hi> therefore he took not, <hi>Law,</hi> in a ſtrict ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed it is true that when <hi>Juſtin</hi> called Chriſt the <hi>New-Law</hi> he did not ſpeak in a <hi>ſtrict and proper ſenſe,</hi> but in a figurative and metonymical <hi>ſenſe,</hi> as was ſhewed before. But what then, I beſeech you? will any ſober Man ſay that becauſe <hi>Juſtin ſometimes wrote figuratively,</hi> therefore he always did ſo, and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at all properly?</hi> Or that becauſe he wrote figuratively, <hi>When he ſaid, Chriſt is the New-Law, therefore</hi> he wrote figuratively <hi>when he ſaid not, that Chriſt is the New-Law,</hi> but ſaid expreſsly (as he is truly quoted in the <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 24. That Chriſt is [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But <hi>Justin</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>C.</hi>) calls this Law a Teſtament, 8 times in that page, and 97 Times in that Dialogue, and ſeldom, I think not above 4 times a <hi>Law</hi> (without the explicatory word Teſtament, added.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> (1.) I do not know certainly <hi>how often Juſtin</hi> calls the Goſpel, <hi>a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>how ſeldom a Law,</hi> throughout that whole Dialogue; for I have not had time, nor indeed thought it worth the while <hi>to take the Poll:</hi> but this I am ſure of, that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is out in his reckoning, for <hi>Juſtin</hi> doth not, in that <hi>Page</hi> 228, call <hi>this Law</hi> Eight times [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> but Seven times in that <hi>Page</hi> And as for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93175:88"/>the Tranſlator, he hath the <hi>Latin nown Teſtamentum,</hi> Teſtament, not Eight times only, but Nine times. But the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> was not <hi>Juſtin</hi> himſelf, but <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Langus.</hi> Here then we find that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is certainly out in his Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if he hath miſtaken in Numbering how often the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> is to be found in one ſingle <hi>Page,</hi> What reaſon have we to believe that he is not much more miſtaken in numbering how often it is to be found throughout the whole Book? He that miſtakes in reckoning Eight, ſure is not to be truſted in reckoning 97; nay, ſince he puts the 8 into the 97, to make up his full number, he muſt be miſtaken in that number 97, as he is in the number 8. And, for ought I know, he may be much more miſtaken in the making up of his whole number: but it is not worth the while to inſiſt upon this any longer. And then for the other, <hi>how ſeldom Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> calls the Goſpel <hi>a Law, whether more than four times,</hi> I will not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that neither, though therein he is miſtaken alſo.</p>
               <p>But I Anſwer (2.) That ſuppoſe it were true which he ſaith (as it is not true) nay, ſuppoſe <hi>Juſtin</hi> had called the Goſpel (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) <hi>a Teſtament,</hi> not only Ninety ſeven times, but Ninety ſeven hundred times; and had but <hi>twice</hi> called it a <hi>new-Law;</hi> yet that would make nothing againſt us, but would make for us, and would fully anſwer the main end for which we cited the Teſtimony of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> which was to prove againſt our Accuſer, that <hi>New-Law</hi> is not <hi>a new Word</hi> of an old ill meaning. For here we ſee, that above Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years agoe, <hi>Juſtin</hi> uſed the word, and called it <hi>a New-Law in a good ſenſe;</hi> and our other Witneſſes add, that it is of <hi>Grace, a Law of Grace,</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Anſ.</hi> What doth Mr. <hi>C.</hi> mean, by ſaying, That <hi>Juſtin</hi> calls it ſo <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Teſtament,</hi> and but <hi>ſeldom a Law,</hi> without the Explicatory word <hi>(Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament)</hi> added? Would he make ſimple people believe that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> wrote in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and uſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>Teſtament</hi> ſo often? I hope he did not deſign any ſuch thing. VVhy what then is the Myſtery? VVhy thus it is; <hi>Juſtin</hi> wrote in <hi>Greek,</hi> and the word he ſo often uſed is <gap reason="foreign">

In Tranſlating the Firſt Teſtimony out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> I did twice render the word. (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to ſignifie the ſame thing. For as he is Quoted in the Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 24. he ſayes, that all Men, whoſoever they be, that would obtain poſſeſſion of the Inheritance of God, muſt now <hi>keep this Covenant or Teſtament, which is of the greateſt Authority of all.</hi> If all Men muſt keep it under the penalty of not obtaining poſſeſſion of the Inheritance of God, becauſe it is (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) the moſt excellent, and of the greateſt Authority of all; then it is plain, that it is a <hi>Law</hi> which preſcribes ſome Duty to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo that their obtaining of the Promiſed Benefit is ſuſpended, till they through Grace, perform the ſaid duty. From all which I may ſafely conclude that <hi>Juſtin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Chriſtian conſtitution of the Goſpel, to be <hi>not only</hi> a New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a New-Covenant alſo, and a New-Law of Grace; and this he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that all Men might know it to be, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by the powerful Grace of God which followed or Accompanied it. By what hath been ſaid it may evidently appear not only to the Subſcribers, but to all
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93175:89"/>other intelligent Readers, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was very pertinently cited in the <hi>Apology,</hi> and that both the <hi>R.</hi> brethrens exceptions againſt his Teſtimony are of no force at all, and have but given me, an occaſion to ſet the truth in a clearer light.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>C. His wiſhing that I had not attempted to prove the New-Law out of the Fathers, ſince</hi> Daille <hi>who was better acquainted with them, ſays it is in vain to make them Judges in many of the controverſies between us and the Papists, and yet the late queſtion concerning the New-Law is a more nice point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, that I freely confeſs my ſelf to be nothing, if compared with the great <hi>Daille,</hi> in that or any other part of Learning; yet I have a deſire to Learn of <hi>Daille,</hi> and he teaches me, that tho we are not to make them Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the controverſies between us and the Papiſts, yet we may make very good uſe of them; as he inſtances in his Treatiſe of the right uſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation. pag. 183. 184, 185, 186, 187. And at the end of pag. 187. He ſaith, <hi>[There ſometimes ariſe ſuch troubleſome Spirits, as will needs broach Doctrines, deviſed of their own heads, which are not at all grounded upon any principle of the Chriſtian Religion; I ſay therefore that the Authority of the Ancients may very properly and ſeaſonably be made uſe of, againſt the impudence of theſe Men: By ſhewing that the Fathers were utterly ignorant of any ſuch fancies, as theſe Men propoſe to the world, and if this can be proved, we ought then certainly, to conclude that no ſuch Doctrine was ever Preached to mankind either by our Saviour Chriſt, or by his Apoſtles. For what probability is there that thoſe. Holy Doctors of former ages, from whoſe hands Chriſtianity hath been derived down to us, ſhould be ignorant of any of thoſe things which had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and recommended by our Saviour, as important and neceſſary to ſalvation?]</hi> Thus <hi>Daille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I Anſwer that my <hi>R.</hi> brother quite miſtakes the matter, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy did not alledge thoſe Fathers <hi>As Judges in matter of right,</hi> but <hi>as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in matter of fact.</hi> So it is expreſsly declared pag. 24. Of the <hi>Apology</hi> in thoſe following words [to prove this, <hi>it being matter of fact,</hi> there needs no more but to ſhew from the <hi>Teſtimony of credible Witneſſes</hi> who lived many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, that <hi>the words</hi> (to wit, <hi>New-Law of Grace</hi>) are <hi>not new,</hi> but were uſed in the Chriſtian Church in a good ſenſe and meaning, <hi>long before we were born.</hi>] This was the thing for the proof whereof we alledged the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe few Ancient Fathers. And we are ſtill perſwaded upon good grounds, that they ſpeak home to the point in queſtion, and do prove the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer to have aſſerted a notorious falſehood in matter of fact, in ſaying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently in Print that <hi>New Law of Grace, is a new word of an old but ill meaning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Anſ.</hi> We think it was very ſeaſonable and highly incumbent upon us, to bring forth the Teſtimonies of Fathers and other Orthodox Divines, who lived and died in the true Faith long before we had a being, when we were publickly accuſed in Print either through ignorance or malice, both of uſing new words, and of Preaching a New and Heretical Goſpel; and thereby, if poſſible, to convince our Brethren, that they were quite out, and that we were no ſuch perſons as they proclaimed us to be, that we uſed no other words, nor Preached any other Doctrine, than what had been uſed and Preached by Ancient Fathers, and Modern Orthodox Divines, who lived and died in the true Faith of Chriſt, many years before us, without being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or accuſed of Preaching a New-Goſpel. And ſo much for Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the pertinency of the Citations out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi>

               <p>In the next place, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> undertakes to ſhew that my citations out of <hi>Cyprian</hi> are not to the purpoſe. For (1.) Tho (ſaith he) <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 11th Epiſtle <hi>Speaks frequently of the Law of the Goſpel, yet he thereby means only that due Diſcipline, which ought to be obſerved in all the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is true that <hi>Cyprian</hi> there by the Law of the Goſpel, means Chriſt's Law of Diſcipline inſtituted in the Goſpel; but then it is as true that the ſaid Law of Diſcipline is a part of the Goſpel-Law; for it is an <hi>adjunct or Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix of the Goſpel-Covenant, or Law of Grace, in its Chriſtian conſtitution, or form of Adminiſtration.</hi> Hence Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, that Holy Diſcipline inſtituted by Chriſt, is a <hi>part</hi> of the Goſpel. His words are,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Sicut autem eſt pars regni Chriſti, ſic etiam eadem ratione eſt pars evangelii—ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que igitur totum chriſti regnum, neque totum evangelium recipiunt, qui rejiciunt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinam, <hi>Ames. Medul. Theolog. lib.</hi> 1. Chap. 37. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>But as it is a part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, ſo alſo in the ſame reſpect it is a part of the Goſpel, therefore they who reject Diſcipline, do neither receive the whole Kingdom of Chriſt, nor the whole Goſpel.</hi>] Thus Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> and the late Reverend Mr. <hi>Gale,</hi> who was Mr. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> Maſter, ſaith in his <hi>Idea Theologiae,</hi> Chap. 8. Sect. 3. pag. 175. That by the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, is meant the Goſpel-Laws which Chriſt hath given to his Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) His exception againſt my other Citations out of <hi>Cyprian's</hi> firſt book to <hi>Quirinus,</hi> (where, in his 10th and 13th Chapters, he expreſsly calls the Goſpel a <hi>New-Law</hi> and a <hi>New-Yoke</hi>) <hi>Is that he meant no more by the New-Law, than what</hi> Juſtin Martyr <hi>did; that is, a New-Doctrine and Inſtitution of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> (1.) Here Mr. G. confeſſes that <hi>by New-Law Cyprian</hi> meant as much as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>no more.</hi> But I have clearly proved from <hi>Juſtin Martyr's</hi> own words, that <hi>by New-Law,</hi> he meant the <hi>New-Covenant-Law</hi> which hath <hi>precepts,</hi> as well as promiſes, and by <hi>its precepts obliges us to duty.</hi> Therefore <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>New-Law,</hi> meant the <hi>New-Covenant-Law</hi> which hath <hi>precepts,</hi> as well as promiſes, and by <hi>its precepts obliges us to duty.</hi> (2.) I Anſwer that this is as clear as the light at noon, from thoſe three Texts of Holy Scripture whereby <hi>Cyprian</hi> proves that a <hi>New-Law of Grace</hi> was to be given. For two of them to wit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. and <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.2. expreſsly call the Goſpel a <hi>Law,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf confeſſeth; and the 3d Text to wit <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. Contains in it one of the principal precepts of the Evangelical New-Law of Grace. For the words are, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> And if <hi>there</hi> be not a precept obliging to duty, there never was a precept either in Law or Goſpel. With what conſcience then, Mr. G. (who knew this) could endeavour to make the world believe, that <hi>Cyprian by New-Law,</hi> meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Doctrine of Grace that requires no duty of Men at all; I know not, let him look to that: But this I know, that if I my ſelf ſhould put ſuch a ſenſe upon the foreſaid words of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I ſhould by ſo doing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put away a good Conſcience, but I ſhould alſo put off all ſenſe of ſhame. All the excuſe that I can make for my Reverend brother is, that (it may be) he was in too much haſte, and did not take time to conſider and weigh <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's</hi> proofs, particularly his proof from <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. That the Goſpel is a <hi>Law</hi> which hath not <hi>only</hi> promiſe but <hi>precept.</hi> (3.) I Anſwer that <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, that the Goſpel is a <hi>New-Yoke,</hi> and proves it by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1.2, 3. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. But Chriſt's <hi>Yoke</hi> ſignifies not only the promiſes to be believed, but alſo the precepts of the Goſpel to be obeyed; as was ſhewed before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cyprian</hi> held the <hi>Goſpel-Law</hi> and Covenant to be a <hi>Doctrine of Grace</hi> which hath both promiſes to be believed and alſo precepts to be obeyed. But Mr. G.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93175:90"/>objects that by <hi>Cyprian's</hi> words as I my ſelf have quoted them, it is evident that he meant not that the Goſpel is a <hi>Law</hi> which requires any duty at all. For he ſays, <hi>That it is another Administration, and that by it, the old</hi> Yoke <hi>ſhould be made null and void.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> A wonderful profound Argument this is, to prove that in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Judgment the Goſpel is not a Law of Grace that hath any precept, becauſe it is an Adminiſtration, or a <hi>Diſpoſition,</hi> as the word in <hi>Cyprian</hi> is, (<hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinum</hi> cap. 11.) And as it is cited, <hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 25. But I pray Sir, why may there not be an Adminiſtration or Diſpoſition of a Precept, as well as of a promiſe? And why may there not be an Adminiſtration, or Diſpoſition both of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and promiſe? Was there not plainly both precept and promiſe in the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> And yet it is written <hi>Acts</hi> 7.53. That the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> received the Law by the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of Angels, but did not keep it. But ſays Mr. <hi>G.</hi> according to <hi>Cyprian</hi> by <hi>the New-Law of Grace,</hi> the old intollerable <hi>Yoke</hi> of Ceremonial legal obſervances was removed. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it hath no precent oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to duty. Wonderful acuteneſs! But however I will venture to deny the Conſequence, and put Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to prove it: For I want Faith to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaith, meerly becauſe he ſaith it. And here I cannot believe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with bleſſed <hi>Cyprian</hi> I believe God the Father himſelf ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; hear ye him.</hi> So much for vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Citations out of <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 3d place he comes to Holy <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> Diſc. p. 65. And ſays, that I force him to be a Witneſs, for the Goſpel-Covenant's being a New-Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Dear Sir, by your own imprudent meddling with things that you ſeem not to have throughly ſtudied nor to underſtand, you force me contrary to my inclination, often to contradict you, and to tell you that it is not true which you ſay: And in this place particularly I am forced by you, to tell you that it is moſt untrue, that I force the words of Holy <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> For I cited him to prove that the words <hi>New-Law</hi> were not <hi>new words,</hi> but of Ancient uſage in the Chriſtian-Church above 12 hundred years ago: And the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which I quoted out of his book of Grace and free will. Chap. 18. Doth as clearly prove this, as ever <hi>matter of Fact</hi> was or can be proved by humane Teſtimony: For he <hi>expreſsly</hi> calls the Goſpel a <hi>New-Law,</hi> and he proves it to be a New-Law <hi>of Grace.</hi> And moreover, he teſtifies more than I cited him for. I cited him only to teſtify that the Goſpel was in old times called a <hi>New-Law,</hi> and he over and above teſtifies that it is a <hi>New-Law, by which precepts are given unto Men.</hi> This his words teſtify without the leaſt force or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to them. But it is Mr. <hi>G.</hi> who would force <hi>Auguſtin's</hi> words to make them ſay what he never meant, yea, to make him deny, what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly affirms. Firſt, he forces <hi>Auguſtins</hi> words to make them ſay, what he never meant. For whereas <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, that <hi>precepts</hi> are <hi>given</hi> unto Men by the <hi>New-Law,</hi> he would force him to ſay only that precepts are given in the books of the New Teſtament. Diſc. p. 66. l. 1. 2, 3. That this is a force put on his words, ſeems very evident by this, that <hi>Auguſtin</hi> by the <hi>New-Law</hi> did not mean the books of the New Teſtament, in which one may find both the Old and New-Law: But he certainly meant the Goſpel it ſelf, or the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace in its Chriſtian conſtitution, or form of Adminiſtration; juſt as by the <hi>Old-Law,</hi> he did not mean only the books of the Old Teſtament, in which according to him, the Old-Law was openly revealed, and the New-Law or Goſpel <hi>lay hidden</hi> and <hi>vailed;</hi> but he meant by the Old-Law, the Old-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Covenant in its old conſtitution and legal form of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:93175:91"/>
               <p n="2">(2.) He forces <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> words to make him deny, what he expreſsly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. For holy <hi>Auguſtin</hi> expreſsly affirms that even the Old-Law had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. His words quoted by me, (<hi>Apol.</hi> pag. 25.) Are that <q>The Grace which is come in the New-Law, was promiſed in the Old-Law.</q> But Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> in his diſcourſe p. 65. l. 31. 32, 33. Forces him to deny that the Old-Law had any promiſes; for ſaith he [That great light of his Age makes the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the New and Old-Law to be, that the Old-Law conſiſted <hi>wholly</hi> in precepts and commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Now <hi>he that</hi> holds that the <hi>Old-Law</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>wholly</hi> in precepts and commands, doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi> hold that the Old-Law had no promiſe. By this I know aſſuredly that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> doth not underſtand the Principles of <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and writes of he knows not well what. As to what he ſays at the end of the Paragraph, of his having reſcued <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. From its perverted meaning; I need ſay no more than I have ſaid before for the clearing of that Text. I leave it to the intelligent Reader to Judge between him and me, and to Determine according to evidence, which of us hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that Text. He that dare pervert the meaning of God's holy word, I wonder not tho he endeavour to pervert (tho ſhamefully enough) every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane word and Teſtimony that is brought againſt him.</p>
               <p n="4">(4thly, Mr. G. excepts againſt the Teſtomony of <hi>Salvian</hi> as not making for me, becauſe (ſaith he) it proves no more than that the Chriſtian-Law, or the Doctrine of Grace, was diſhonoured by ſome Mens abuſing it to Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. I Anſwer, that <hi>Salvian's</hi> Teſtimony proves all, that it was brought for, and that was only to prove that in the 5th Century, the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was called a <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian-Law.</hi> This Mr. <hi>G.</hi> doth not deny, but inſinuates that by <hi>Chriſtian-Law Salvian</hi> meant nothing but a Doctrine of Grace, which hath <hi>no precepts</hi> and requires no duty of us at all. But if my <hi>R. B.</hi> once read over all <hi>Salvian</hi> and underſtand what he reads, I hope he will never be ſo ſhameleſs as to deny plain matter of fact. For if I be put to it, I ſhall (if the Lord will) prove by his expreſs words, that he called the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel not only the Chriſtian-Law, but the <hi>New-Law,</hi> and that it is a <hi>New-Law</hi> which hath <hi>precepts</hi> that oblige to duty. Thus I have juſtified my citations out of the four Fathers, <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Cyprian, Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Salvian,</hi> and have confirmed and ſtrengthened their Teſtimonies, by ſhewing that they prove what they were cited for, and more too. Now we muſt ſee what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions Mr. <hi>G.</hi> brings againſt my Modern Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>And (1.) He excepts againſt <hi>Bradwardin</hi> becauſe he was a Papiſt. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, behold here the Juſtice, and fair dealing of thoſe Men with whom we have to do! They bring <hi>Bradwardin</hi> to witneſs for them <hi>againſt us;</hi> and <hi>then</hi> he is a good witneſs, <hi>tho he be a Papiſt.</hi> But when we bring him to witneſs <hi>for us</hi> againſt them, then he is no good witneſs, and his Teſtimony ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>becauſe he is a Papiſt.</hi> The truth is, we had not mentioned <hi>Bradwardin</hi> in this cauſe, if he had not been firſt publickly Summoned by Mr. G's good Friend <hi>our Accuſer,</hi> to witneſs againſt us. And if they will confeſs that they did fooliſhly in firſt mentioning him againſt us; they ſhall hear no more of him from us, as a witneſs againſt them. For I declare I do not at all value his Teſtimony <hi>meerly as it is his Teſtimony:</hi> And I think that in the <hi>Apol.</hi> I have ſhewed ſufficient reaſon why no true Chriſtian ſhould value his Teſtimony, meerly becauſe it is his Teſtimony: And that (with a <hi>non obſtante</hi>) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that high eſteem, which Mr. G. ſaith he hath obtained among Men. And yet becauſe it is in my Judgment unlawful to belye either the Pope or Devil; I muſt forbear ſaying either that <hi>Bradwardin aſſerted works,</hi> done by Grace <hi>to
<pb facs="tcp:93175:91"/>be ſtrictly and properly meritorious,</hi> or that with incomparable ſtrength, and cloſeneſs of <hi>reaſon,</hi> he refuted the <hi>Pelagian Hereſies in all Points;</hi> till Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> hath clearly proved both theſe matters of Fact; for I have ſome reaſon to doubt <hi>whether they be both true;</hi> and as to one of them, I gave one reaſon of my doubting, in the <hi>Apology, p.</hi> 164. and another in <hi>p.</hi> 133.</p>
               <p n="2">(2dly,) He endeavours to elude the Teſtimony of the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> by ſaying, That they <hi>only mean</hi> that the Goſpel in a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>improper ſenſe,</hi> may be termed a Law, becauſe there are Precepts, Commands, and Threatings in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ah <hi>poor Writing,</hi> I would I had wherewithal to cover thy Nakedneſs; but that is out of my power: for the <hi>Leyden</hi> Profeſſors give no ſuch Reaſon why the Goſpel may be termed <hi>a Law, becauſe there are Precepts, Commands and Threatnings in the Books of the New Teſtament:</hi> But they ſay expreſsly (as cited in the <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 27.) that the Goſpel is ſometimes called a Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it <hi>alſo</hi> hath its <hi>Own</hi> Commandments, and its <hi>Own</hi> Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. Mark ye (1.) They do not ſay, <hi>it may be improperly</hi> called a <hi>Law,</hi> but that it is called a <hi>Law.</hi> (2.) They do not ſay, that it is called a Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Precepts, Commands, and Threatnings in the <hi>Books</hi> of the New Teſtament, but becauſe it <hi>alſo</hi> hath its <hi>own</hi> Commandments, and its <hi>own</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings; that is plainly, That as the old Covenant of Works had its own Commandments, and its own Promiſes and Threatnings; ſo alſo the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>New Covenant of Grace,</hi> hath its <hi>own Commandments,</hi> and its own Promiſes and Threatnings.</p>
               <p n="3">(3dly,) As the Promiſes of the Goſpel are <hi>its own,</hi> ſo are the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Threatnings of it <hi>its own;</hi> but the Promiſes are its own, becauſe they properly belong to it; then alſo are the Commandments and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings its <hi>own,</hi> for the ſame reaſon, becauſe they properly belong to it. For the worthy and Learned Profeſſors make no difference, but ſay, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Promiſes and Threatnings are all <hi>its own.</hi> Now this is the <hi>very true reaſon,</hi> why I, according to Scripture, <hi>call</hi> the Goſpel <hi>a Law.</hi> As for what Mr. G. <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 67. cites out of <hi>Polyander there,</hi> it makes nothing againſt what he ſays <hi>here,</hi> in the paſſage now under conſideration: but at the moſt ſhews, that <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a word of various ſignification; which I have freely granted, and fully ſpoken to before. And as <hi>Polyander</hi> renounced the <hi>Popiſh, Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> opinion concerning the <hi>New Law;</hi> ſo do <hi>I</hi> and my Brethren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſelf-ſame Opinion. And yet in the ſence of the Orthodox, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Divines, we believe the Goſpel to be a <hi>New Law</hi> of Grace, and which is the ſame thing in other words, a New Covenant of Grace, which hath Commands, Promiſes, and Threatnings of its own.</p>
               <p n="3">(3dly,) He endeavours to put by the Teſtimony of <hi>Gomarus,</hi> by ſaying, That he underſtood the Goſpel in its larger acceptation, when he called it a Law in the place cited by me, and pretends to have made this out in the 34th <hi>Page</hi> of his Diſcourſe, to which he refers his <hi>Reader.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In my Remarks and Animadverſions on his Sixth Chapter, I have clearly and fully refuted that part of his Diſcourſe, and ſhewed how groſly he abuſes <hi>Gomarus,</hi> by wreſting his words to an abſurd ſenſe, which they are no ways capable of, to wit, that <hi>there</hi> the word <hi>Goſpel</hi> is not taken by <hi>Gomarus</hi> for God's Covenant of Grace only, but for all the ſecond part of the Bible, that is, all the Books of the New Teſtament. I proved from <hi>Gomarus</hi> his own words, that by the word <hi>[Goſpel]</hi> he neither did nor could underſtand <hi>there,</hi> all the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> but that really he there underſtood
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93175:92"/>by the Goſpel, <hi>the very Covenant of Grace it ſelf, both diſcover'd to, and made with Man, and recorded in the Books both of Old and New Teſtament;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that <hi>there</hi> he called the ſame Covenant of Grace, God's Law, <hi>becauſe of the duty required in it, and the condition preſcribed by it.</hi> To which I ſhall only add now, that in the <hi>Apology, p.</hi> 100. I cited the 29th <hi>Poſition,</hi> which <hi>Gomarus</hi> lays down next before the 30th that <hi>here</hi> is under conſideration; and in that 29th <hi>Poſition</hi> he ſaith <q>That the Goſpel is called God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, becauſe it promulgates the mutual Obligation of God and Men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the giving them Eternal Life, upon their performing a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and that it is called the Covenant, concerning free Salvation by Chriſt, becauſe God, in the Goſpel, of mere Grace, publiſhes, and offereth unto all Men whatſoever, on condition of true Faith, not only Chriſt, and perfect Righteouſneſs in him for Reconciliation and Eternal Life; but alſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth unto his Elect, and perfecteth in them, the preſcribed Condition of Faith and Repentance.]</q> Theſe are <hi>Gomarus</hi> his own words truly Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, which, together with his 30th <hi>Poſition,</hi> that next follows in order, do ſufficiently refute Mr, G'<hi>s</hi> Gloſs, and may make him <hi>Bluſh</hi> for ſo groſly abuſing that Great Man, and moſt Zealous <hi>Anti-Arminian.</hi>

                  <hi>(Fourthly,)</hi> Mr. G. having <hi>paſſed over</hi> the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> the learned Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> comes, in the laſt place, to Dr. <hi>Twiſs,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, by a ſhort Anſwer, to take off his Teſtimony, and to ſhew, that it is nothing to the purpoſe: And his ſhort <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, That all which can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the words of Dr, <hi>Twiſs, is only this,</hi> That God hath appointed a ſet and ſtated order in our Salvation, according to which <hi>He</hi> proceeds.</p>
               <p>I reply, That this <hi>Anſwer</hi> is <hi>ſhort</hi> indeed; and that is no fault at all: but the fault of it is, that it is moſt <hi>falſe,</hi> as doth moſt evidently appear by Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> his own expreſs and formal words, quoted at large in the <hi>Apology.</hi> I appeal to any Man of common ſenſe, that can read and underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if withall he be a Man of Common Honeſty and Ingenuity, whether (1.) Dr. <hi>Twiſs</hi> doth not ſay, that in the very Goſpel there is a <hi>Poſitive Law,</hi> according to which God proceeds in his dealings with Men. (2.) That the ſaid poſitive law is not only a <hi>Law</hi> to God himſelf, but that it is a <hi>poſitive law to us, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us a ſet and ſtated order of walking, and preſcribing a condition to be performed by us through Grace,</hi> that we may obtain Salvation for the ſake of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs only. (3.) That the ſaid order is, by neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence, a <hi>conditional order</hi> with reſpect to us, and that it <hi>is required</hi> of us to obſerve the Conditional Order, and <hi>to perform the condition,</hi> in order to obtain the bleſſing and benefit promiſed conditionally in the Goſpel. Theſe three things are ſo evident by the words of Dr, <hi>Twiſs,</hi> that it is needleſs to uſe further reaſoning to make them more evident; and therefore I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear doing it at preſent; and only refer the matter to the judgment of every underſtanding conſcientious Reader, who ſhall be at the pains to peruſe my Citations out of <hi>Twiſs.</hi> Thus I have clearly vindicated all the Citations that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath excepted againſt, and endeavoured to elude; and have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſtand in full force, and do very pertinently prove the matter, for the proof whereof they were brought in the <hi>Apology:</hi> and that his Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo poor and mean, yea falſe and foul, that he had done more prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had better conſulted his own credit and reputation, as an Ingenuous Man, and a Schollar, if he had done by all my Witneſſes, as he did by Dr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> paſſed them all over, and ſaid nothing to them at all.</p>
               <p>But before he make an end of his Eighth <hi>Chapter,</hi> he undertakes in <hi>P.</hi> 68.

This muſt <hi>not</hi> the Miniſter do, becauſe <hi>this would fright the wicked man and make him think, that the Miniſter were ſending him to Hell.</hi> Well, but what muſt the Miniſter do then? why that Mr. G. tells us in the ſecond place, and the ſum of his Advice you may take, thus: <q>Poor Sinner, by the Covenant of life and ſalvation, God requires neither Faith nor Repentance of thee, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no Duty of thee at all by the Goſpel, for that is all Promiſe, abſolute Promiſe: but if God hath Decreed to ſave thee, he hath Bleſſings in ſtore for thee, and all Bleſſings of the Covenant are inſeparably linked together, and thou ſhalt have one and all of them: never trouble thy head then about Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, and Repenting of thy Sins, for theſe are Duties which the Goſpel requires not of thee. But look thou on Faith and Repentance as Bleſſings given, not as Duties required by the Goſpel; and laying thy hand on thy heart, if thou findeſt the Bleſſings of Faith and Repentance there, then all is well, and thou mayeſt be aſſured of thy Intereſt in all other bleſſings.</q> This, it ſeems, is <hi>his way of viſiting the Sick,</hi> and thus <hi>he would Inſtruct</hi> other Miniſters to Viſit them; and if we may believe himſelf, he hath, by this, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered that part of our <hi>Apology</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 32, 33. which relates to this matter. But whether this be a ſufficient Anſwer, I am content, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one word more of Reply, to refer it unto the Judgment of the Intelligent and Godly Reader.</p>

            <head>Remarks on his 9th Chapter.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s Deſign in this his laſt Chapter, is to make ſimple unlearned People believe, That our Opinion of the Goſpel's being a New Covenant, or Law of grace, which hath its own Commandments, and its own Promiſes and Threatnings, <hi>doth too much agree</hi> with the <hi>Popiſh, Socinian,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Opinion concerning the <hi>New Law.</hi> And it appears to be very dangerous to agree with them in that Opinion, Firſt, becauſe, as he ſays, <q>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> do in that opinion, lay the ſureſt foundation for that dear Article of their Faith, the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93175:93"/>merit of works. Secondly, becauſe, the Arminians and Socinians do zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly eſpouſe it, as a moſt effectual engine to overthrow Juſtification by the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</q> Whether this be altogether true or not is not my preſent buſineſs to enquire; if they really do what Mr. G. charges them with, they certainly do a very ill thing: And we are fo far from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them therein, that we utterly deteſt and abhor it. And as we ſaid in the <hi>Apol.</hi> p. 39. So we ſay again, that <q>To affirm that we agree with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Arminians, or Socinians in this or any other opinion, that lays a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the merit of works, and is an effectual Engine to overthrow Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. is as falſe, as any thing that ever came out of the mouth of the Father of lies.</q> Since then we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold the Goſpel to be a <q>New-Law, in the ſenſe that Papiſts, Arminians, and Socinians, hold it to be a New-Law, to wit which lays a Foundation for the merit of works, and is an Engine to overthrow Juſtification by the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</q> His many citations out of Popiſh-School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſome out of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> are <hi>utterly impertinent</hi> to prove our agreement with them in their Erroneous Doctrines.</p>
            <p>I adviſe therefore my <hi>R.</hi> brother to forbear aſſerting, or inſinuating ſuch things for the future. He thereby doth himſelf more hurt, than he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do unto us; for thoſe that know both him and us, will never believe any ſuch thing of us, upon his Teſtimony concerning us. He blames me for being ſo liberal in beſtowing Titles of diſhonour upon thoſe who differ from me, as to call them <hi>Antinomians.</hi> But Reverend Sir, where do I in the <hi>Apol. call any</hi> that differ from me, <hi>Antinomians,</hi> but <hi>ſuch as are Antinimians,</hi> and moſt of them were ſo called by ſound Proteſtants, before I was born, or was capable of underſtanding any thing of theſe matters? As for the <hi>Congregational</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I am ſure that in the <hi>Apol.</hi> I was ſo far from calling them <hi>Antinomians,</hi> that I declared I did not ſo much <hi>as ſuſpect</hi> them to be <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended many of them for their zealous and vigorous oppoſing of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſm.</hi> If any of the perſwaſion of our Reverend Brethren have fallen into <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> that is no diſhonour to them from whoſe Principles theſe Men are fallen, ſo long as they themſelves continue ſtedfaſt, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reclaim ſuch as at any time fall into any <hi>Antinomian</hi> error. My <hi>R.</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows well enough, that it was his good Friend the <hi>Informer and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> who neceſſitated us, in our own juſt vindication to mention thoſe Names of diſtinction, and without that neceſſity put upon us, he ſhould never have heard of ſuch Names from me. And for his declaring that he will brand me, with none of thoſe hated Names, Diſc. p. 74. I thank him for <hi>doing me juſtice,</hi> ſince he <hi>cannot</hi> charge me with any erroneous opinion either of Papiſts, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, or Socininians, <hi>without doing me a manifeſt injury.</hi> And yet within the compaſs of ſix lines (after he had declared <hi>that he did not ſo much as think me</hi> to be on the ſide either of Papiſts, Arminians or Socinians) he undertakes Diſc. p. 74. to prove that <hi>the merit of works</hi> which I diſclaim, <hi>Is really included in my Hypotheſis.</hi> And his Argument to prove it, we have in theſe following words. <q>[What is merit, but when the reward is due to ſome work done? Now if the Goſpel be in that reſpect a Law, that it requires duties as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of having a claim to its bleſſings, and promiſes them to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe conditions, then to them performed, tho of never ſo little conſideration, the bleſſings muſt be given, not as the fruits of meer Grace, but as the reſult of a juſt debt.]</q> This is his Argument whereby he would, prove that the Doctrine of merit, is included in my Hypotheſis: It may be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93175:93"/>he learned this Argument from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when he was at <hi>Rome:</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that be ſo or not, yet certain it is, that it is one of their <hi>poor</hi> Arguments for the Merit of Works, which they uſe againſt us; and our <hi>Proteſtant Divines</hi> have ſo often Anſwered it, and Baffled it, that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> might have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to bring it again upon the Stage.</p>

               <hi>Alſted</hi> many years ago, brought in the <hi>Papiſts</hi> urging this Argument for Merit of Works, againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and he gave it a clear <hi>Anſwer.</hi> His Words are,

Thoſe Promiſes, whereby Eternal Life is promiſed to good works, do not promiſe the right unto, but the Poſſeſſion of Eternal Life. Therefore good works are not conditions antecedent, cauſal, and meritorious; but conſequent, in reſpect of the right to Eternal Life; and preparatory, in order to the poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

            <p>And <hi>Eſſenius</hi> thus Anſwers the ſelf-ſame Objection of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> in theſe following words:
<note n="†" place="bottom">Qui benè promiſit, promiſsis ſtare debet ratione fidelitatis, quae in juſtitiâ univerſali continetur: non tamen ſemper ratione juſtitiae particularis; neque promiſsio hoc efficit neceſſario, ut qui adjectam conditionem praeſtiterit, tem promiſſam tanquam mercedem ex debito, jure ſuo exigere poſſe dicatur. Quid ſi enim pauperi promiſerim, me ei daturum eleemoſynam, ubi me domi meae compellaverit; certè propter iſtam promiſſionem non deſinet eſſe eleemoſyna, neque fiet actus Juſtitiae particularis, aut retributio mercedis ex debito.

               <hi>He that hath rightly promiſed, ought to perform his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in point of faithfulneſs, which is comprehended in univerſal Justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he is not always bound ſo to do, in regard of particular Juſtice. Nor is this the neceſſary effect of a Promiſe, that he who hath performed the condition annexed to the Promiſe, may be ſaid to have right to demand the thing Promiſed, as a reward due to him on the account of Juſtice. For what if I ſhould promiſe a poor Man that I will give him an Alms if he will come and call on me at my Houſe; ſurely that Promiſe will not make it ceaſe to be an Alms, nor will it, by reaſon of that Promiſe, become an act of particular Juſtice, or a Retribution of a Reward, as of due debt.</hi>] Thus <hi>Eſſenius</hi> Anſwered that Argument of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93175:94"/>of Works; and Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Argument being in effect the very ſame, there need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no other Anſwer to be given unto it. And before he had ſo publickly made uſe of this poor <hi>Popiſh</hi> Argument, he ſhould have conſider'd the import of the Fifth Article of the 16th Chapter of our own Confeſſion of Faith, where it is ſaid expreſly, that <q>[We cannot by our beſt works Merit Pardon of Sin, or Eternal Life at the hand of God, by reaſon of the great diſproportion that is between them, and the Glory to come, and the infinite diſtance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and God, whom, by them, we can neither profit, nor ſatisfie for the debt of our former ſins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable ſervants; and becauſe as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit; and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with ſo much weakneſs, and imperfection, that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Severity of God's Judgment.]</q> If my R. Brother had conſider'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and believed this part of the Confeſſion of Faith; he would never have taken it for granted, that <hi>Merit is nothing but the dueneſs of a reward to ſome work done.</hi> For, our Confeſſion of Faith teaches us, that many things are neceſſary to make a work Meritorious, beſides the Reward's being due to it. (1.) It is neceſſary that there be a proportion between the work done, and the bleſſing or reward promiſed. (2.) That there be not an infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between Man the Worker, and God the Rewarder. (3.) That the Work done be profitable unto God for whom it is done. (4.) That before our Works can Merit the pardon of Sin, they muſt be able to ſatisfie God's Juſtice for the Debt of Sin. (5.) That our Works be not due to God, by vertue of his Command requiring them. (6.) That the Works be our own, done by our own ſtrength. (7.) That they be moſt perfect, and done as well as they ought to be. Theſe are the Conditions neceſſary to make a work Meritorious of pardon of ſin and Eternal Life. And if theſe things be ſo, What deſerves Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Queſtion <hi>(What is Merit, but when the reward is due to ſome work done?)</hi> but to be hiſſed at? And yet for his information, that he may hereafter know my Principles better than he ſeems to do, I tell him, that in my Judgment, to ſpeak ſtrictly, the <hi>Reward is not due to the VVork,</hi> nor to <hi>the VVorker for the VVork's ſake:</hi> and yet I hold the Reward to be due; But to whom, and for whom? I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Reward, to wit, of Eternal Life, it is due to the Penitent Believer, in whoſe heart Chriſt dwells by Faith, and it is due to him by the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God, who is faithful and cannot lie; and it is due to him <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> who, as he hath ſatisfied the Juſtice of God for all our ſins, ſo he hath Merited for us all the Bleſſings and Benefits of the New Covenant from firſt to laſt. Now this being my Hypotheſis, founded upon the VVord of God, and agreeable to our Confeſsion of Faith, as I have fully and clearly proved in the foreſaid Remarks on my Reverend Brother's Diſcourſe of the Goſpel, I refer it to all Men of Underſtanding, Sobriety, and Conſcience, to Judge whether this be true which he ſayes, <hi>That the Merit of VVorks is really included in my Hypotheſis.</hi> At laſt, being conſcious to himſelf that he can never prove that our Principle agrees with the <hi>Popiſh, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines, as he had aſſerted in the <hi>Contents</hi> of his 9th <hi>Chapter;</hi> he gives over his Accuſing us Falſly, and concludes with Counſel and Advice to <hi>forbear ſuch Phraſes and Modes of Speech,</hi> as by the Enemies of the Goſpel are made uſe of to very ill purpoſes; and that is, to lay aſide the uſe of the words <hi>New Law.</hi> VVhereunto I Anſwer, That I am very willing to be Counſelled and Adviſed by thoſe that are wiſer than my ſelf; and though I remember ſomething of the <hi>Fox</hi> in the <hi>Apologue,</hi> yet I will agree with my Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that for my own part, I will forbear calling the Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

That he, and his Friend, for whom he VVrites, will confeſs the Truth of that which I have proved, to wit, that it is a <hi>Notorious Falſhood</hi> in matter of Fact, that <hi>New Law of Grace, is a New VVord of an old Ill-meaning.</hi> Provided (2.) That as I ſhall not uſe the <hi>Adjective, New,</hi> when I call the Goſpel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>a Law,</hi> or, <hi>a Law of Grace;</hi> ſo he will himſelf uſe the word <hi>Law,</hi> and call the Goſpel by that Name, as the Scripture doth; and not be <hi>offended with us,</hi> for calling it a <hi>Law,</hi> and a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> and <hi>for believing,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. that it is frequently called <hi>a Law,</hi> becauſe <hi>it hath the Nature and Power of a Law,</hi> &amp;c. and with the Profeſſors of <hi>Leyden,</hi> that it is ſometimes called <hi>a Law,</hi> becauſe it hath <hi>alſo</hi> its <hi>own</hi> Commandments, and its <hi>own</hi> Promiſes and Threatnings.

Provided, that my agreeing not to uſe the Adjective <hi>New,</hi> when I call the Goſpel <hi>a Law,</hi> and <hi>a Law of Grace, ſhall not be conſtrued to ſuch a ſenſe, as if I thereby ſignified, that I account it unlawful to call the Goſpel a New Law,</hi> for I do not ſo account it; but on the contrary, <hi>I hold it very lawful to call the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel a New Law,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe we call it <hi>a New Covenant.</hi> The Reaſons why I hold it lawful to call the Goſpel <hi>a New Law,</hi> are theſe; (1.)

Dordrect. part.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 104. and <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 124. and 139. and 208. —That excellent Perſon Mr. <hi>Hugh Binning,</hi> called the Goſpel a <hi>New Law,</hi> in his <hi>Sinners Sanctuary,</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>p.</hi> 72. And Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> expreſly called it, <hi>The Law of Grace. Durham</hi> on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Firſt Edit. <hi>p.</hi> 259. For theſe Reaſons I hold it very lawful to call the Goſpel a <hi>New Law.</hi> And yet if my Reverend Brother pleaſe, I will agree with him <hi>upon the termes,</hi> and <hi>with the proviſo's aforeſaid;</hi> to lay aſide the word <hi>New,</hi> and will content my ſelf with calling the Goſpel <hi>a Law, and a Law of Grace.</hi> But if he will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Termes and Conditions before-mentioned, then be it known to all Men whom it may concern, that it is no fault of mine that we are not agreed as to this matter; for I have <hi>offer'd to deny my ſelf the uſe of my juſt liberty for Peace ſake:</hi> and <hi>more I cannot do</hi> with a good Conſcience, and therefore through Grace will not do it. The Scriptures of truth often call the Goſpel <hi>a Law,</hi> and I have proved from Scripture, that it is a <hi>Law of Grace,</hi> therefore I believe it to be <hi>a Law,</hi> and <hi>a Law of Grace,</hi> a Law of Grace, <hi>that hath its own Commandments, and its own Promiſes and Treatnings;</hi> and as I believe, ſo I Speak and Write. I impoſe on no Man's Conſcience, and I hope no <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> will <hi>ſeek to impoſe upon mine.</hi> I will not deny my inward beliefe of the Goſpel's being a New Covenant, or Law of Grace, but intend, through Grace, to live and die in the profeſsion of that Faith. But as for the uſe of the words <hi>New Law,</hi> ſimply, and <hi>without any addition</hi> of ſomething that may explain their meaning, I am content <hi>on the termes aforeſaid,</hi> to forbear it, as <hi>Beza</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. But if my R. Brother <hi>do not agree</hi> to the Termes ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall Conclude with the Teſtimony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who, in his Book of <hi>Preſcription</hi> againſt <hi>Hereticks,</hi> tells us, That in his Time (<hi>i. e.</hi> near Fifteen hundred years ago, and before <hi>the Roman Anti-Chriſt was born</hi>) It was a part of the Rule of Faith, or Creed, univerſally believed by all Orthodox Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, That Chriſt Preached <hi>the New Law and Promiſe</hi> of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; whereby <hi>Tertullian</hi> meant, the New Covenant of Grace, as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Duty, and preſcribes Conditions unto Men; and promiſes Bleſsings and Benefits, for Chriſt's ſake, unto thoſe, who, through the Grace of the Spirit, perform the Duties and Conditions preſcribed, whereof the main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal is Faith in Chriſt. This is evident, by what he Writes in his Book againſt the <hi>Jews, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 122. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 125. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 131. And in his Fourth and Fifth Books againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>His words in his Book of <hi>Preſcription</hi> againſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> are as followeth: <q>
